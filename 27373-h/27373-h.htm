<h2>FLORA LYNDSAY;<br />
<small><small>OR,</small><br />
PASSAGES IN AN EVENTFUL LIFE.</small></h2>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span><a name="I" id="I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>A MATRIMONIAL DIALOGUE.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Flora</span>, have you forgotten the talk we had about emigration, the
morning before our marriage?&#8221; was a question rather suddenly put
to his young wife, by Lieutenant Lyndsay, as he paused in his walk
to and fro the room. The fact is, that he had been pondering over
that conversation for the last hour.</p>

<p>It had long been forgotten by his wife; who, seated upon the sofa
with a young infant of three years old in her lap, was calmly
watching its sleeping face with inexpressible delight. She now
left off her maternal studies; and looked up at her husband, with
an inquiring glance,&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you ask, dear John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you turned Quaker, Flora, that you cannot give one a <em>direct</em>
answer?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>&#8220;I have not forgotten it. But we have been so happy ever since,
that I have never given it a second thought. What put it into your
head just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That child&#8212;and thinking how I could provide for her, in any
other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear little pet! She cannot add much to our expenses.&#8221; And the
mother bent over her sleeping child, and kissed its soft, velvet
cheek, with a zest that mothers alone know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at present. But the little pet will in time grow into a tall
girl; and other little pets may be treading upon her footsteps;
and they must all be clothed, and fed, and educated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora, in her overflowing happiness, had dismissed all such cruel
realities from her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Emigration is a terrible word, John. I wish that it could be
expunged from our <em>English</em> dictionary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, my dear girl, that you are destined to learn a
practical illustration of its meaning. Nay, don&#8217;t look so
despondingly. If you intended to remain in England, you should not
have married a <em>poor</em> man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, John, or you will make me miserable. Our marriage
made me rich in treasures, which gold could never buy. But
seriously, I do not see this urgent necessity for taking such a
hazardous step. I know that we are not rich&#8212;that our expectations
on that score for the future<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> are very limited. We are both the
younger children of large families, whose wealth and consequence
is now a thing of the past. We have nothing to hope or anticipate
from rich relations; but we have enough to be comfortable, and are
surrounded with many blessings. Our little girl, whose presence
seems to have conjured before you the gaunt image of poverty, has
added greatly to our domestic happiness. Yes, little Miss
Innocence! you are awake, are you? Come, crow to papa, and drive
these ugly thoughts out of his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good father kissed fondly the young thing seducingly held up
to him. But he did not yield to the temptation, or swerve from his
purpose, though Flora kissed <em>him</em>, with eyes brimful of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are indeed happy, love. Too happy, I might say. But will it
last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our income is <em>very</em> small?&#8221; with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is enough for our present wants. And we have no debts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to your prudent management. Yes, we have no debts. But it
has been a hard battle, only gained by great self-denial, and much
pinching. We have kind friends, too. But Flora, I am too proud to
be indebted to friends for the common necessaries of life; and
without doing something to improve our scanty means, it might come
to that. The narrow income which has barely supplied our wants
this year, without the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> incumbrance of a family, will not do so
next. There remains no alternative but to <em>emigrate</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora felt that this was pressing her hard. All her affectionate
ingenuity could not furnish an argument against such home truths.
&#8220;Let us drop this hateful subject,&#8221; said she, hastily; &#8220;I cannot
bear to think about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear girl, we must force ourselves to think about it,
calmly and dispassionately; and having determined which is the
path of duty, we must follow it out, without any reference to our
own likes and dislikes. Our marriage would have been a most
imprudent one, had it been contracted on any other terms; and we
are both to blame that we have loitered away so many months of
valuable time in happy ease, when we should have been earning
independence for ourselves and our family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be right, John,&#8212;yes, I know that you are right. But it
is no such easy matter to leave your home and country, and the
dear friends whose society renders life a blessing and poverty
endurable&#8212;to abandon a certain good for an uncertain better, to
be sought for among untried difficulties. I would rather live in a
cottage in England, upon brown bread and milk, than occupy a
palace on the other side of the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This sounds very prettily in poetry, Flora; but, my dear girl,
life is made up of stern realities, and it is absolutely necessary
for us to provide against the dark hour before it comes suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
upon us. Our future prospects press upon my heart and brain too
forcibly to be neglected. I have thought long and painfully upon
the subject, and I have come to the resolution to emigrate this
spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner the better. The longer we defer it, the more
difficulties we shall have to encounter. The legacy left you by
your aunt will pay our expenses out, and enable us, without
touching my half-pay, to purchase a farm in Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Canada!&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora&#8217;s eye brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so glad that it is not to the Cape of Good Hope!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this decision, Flora, I have yielded to <em>your</em> wishes. My
<em>own</em> inclinations would lead me back to a country where I have
dear friends, a large tract of land, and where some of the
happiest years of my life were spent. You are not wise, Flora, to
regard the Cape with such horror. No person would delight more in
the beautiful and romantic scenery of that country than yourself.
You have taken up a foolish prejudice against the land I love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not that, dear John. But you know, I have such a terror of
the wild beasts&#8212;those dreadful snakes and lions! I never should
dare to stir beyond the garden, for fear of being stung or
devoured. And then, I have been bored to death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> about the Cape, by
our good friends the P&#8212;&mdash;&#8217;s, till I hate the very name of the
place!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will perhaps one day find out your error, Flora; and your
fears are perfectly absurd! Not wishing to render your emigration
more painful, by taking you to a country to which you are so
averse, I have made choice of Canada, hoping that it might be more
to your taste. The only obstacle in the way, is the reluctance you
feel at leaving your friends. Am I less dear to you, Flora, than
friends and country?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was said so kindly, and with such an affectionate earnestness
for her happiness more than his own&#8212;for it was no small sacrifice
to Lyndsay to give up going back to the Cape&#8212;that it overcame all
Flora&#8217;s obstinate scruples.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8212;you are more to me than all the world! I will try
and reconcile myself to any change, for your sake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go first, and leave you with your mother until I have
arranged matters in Canada?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a separation would be worse than death! I would rather
encounter a thousand dangers, than remain in England without you!
If it must be, I will never say another word against it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here followed a heavy sigh. The young husband kissed the tears
from her cheek, and whispered&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;That she was his dear, good girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Flora would have followed him to the deserts of Arabia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I have had a long conversation with a very sensible, practical
man,&#8221; continued Lyndsay, &#8220;who has lately come to England upon
colonial business. He has been a settler for some years in Canada,
and the accounts he has given me of the colony are so favourable,
and hold out such encouragement of ultimate success and
independence, that they have decided me in my choice of making a
trial of the backwoods. I promised to meet him this morning at the
Crown Inn (where he puts up), to look over maps and plans, and
have some further talk upon the subject. I thought, dear, that it
was better for me to consult you upon the matter before I took any
decided steps. You have borne the ill news better than I expected:
so keep up your spirits until I return, which will not be long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora remained in deep thought for some time after the door had
closed upon her husband. She could now recal every word of that
eventful conversation, which they had held together the morning
before their marriage, upon the subject of emigration. In the
happy prospect of becoming his wife, it had not then appeared to
her so terrible.</p>

<p>Faithfully had he reminded her of the trials she must expect to
encounter, in uniting her destiny to a poor gentleman, and had
pointed out emigration as the only remedy for counteracting the
imprudence of such a step; and Flora, full of love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> and faith, was
not hard to be persuaded. She considered that to be his wife,
endowed as he was by nature with so many moral and intellectual
qualities, with a fine face and noble form, would make her the
richest woman in the world: that there was in him a mine of mental
wealth, which could never decrease, but which time and experience
would augment, and come what might, she in the end was sure to be
the gainer.</p>

<p>She argued thus:&#8212;&#8220;Did I marry a man whom I could not love, merely
for his property, and the position he held in society, misfortune
might deprive him of these, and a disagreeable companion for life
would remain to remind me constantly of my choice. But a generous,
talented man like Lyndsay, by industry and prudence may become
rich, and then the most avaricious worlding would applaud the step
I had taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>We think after all, that Flora reasoned wisely, and, acting up to
her convictions, did right. The world, we know, would scarcely
agree with us; but in matters of the heart, the world is rarely
consulted.</p>

<p>They were married, and, retiring to a pretty cottage upon the
sea-coast, confined their expenditure to their limited means, and
were contented and happy, and so much in love with each other and
their humble lot, that up to this period, all thoughts upon the
dreaded subject of emigration had been banished from one mind, at
least. Flora knew her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> husband too well to suspect him of changing
a resolution he had once formed on the suggestion of duty. She
felt, too, that he was right,&#8212;that painful as the struggle was,
to part with all dear to her on earth, save him, that it must be
made. &#8220;Yes, I can, and will dare all things, my beloved husband,
for your sake,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My heart may at times rebel, but I will
shut out all its weak complainings. I am ready to follow you
through good and ill,&#8212;to toil for our future maintenance, or live
at ease. England&#8212;my country! the worst trial will be to part from
you.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE OLD CAPTAIN.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Flora&#8217;s</span> reveries were abruptly dispelled by a gentle knock at the
door; and her &#8220;Come in,&#8221; was answered by a tall, portly, handsome
old lady, who sailed into the room in all the conscious dignity of
black silk and white lawn.</p>

<p>The handsome old lady was Mrs. Kitson, the wife of the naval
officer, whose ready-furnished lodgings they had occupied for the
last year. Flora rose to meet her visitor, with the baby still
upon her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Kitson, I am happy to see you. Pray take the easy-chair by
the fire. I hope your cough is better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No chance of that,&#8221; said the healthy old lady, who had never
known a fit of dangerous illness in her life, &#8220;while I continue so
weak. Hu&#8212;hu&#8212;hu&#8212;. You see, my dear, that it is as bad as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora thought that she never had seen a person at Mrs. Kitson&#8217;s
advanced stage of life with such a healthy, rosy visage. But every
one has some pet weakness. Mrs. Kitson&#8217;s was always fancying
herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> ill and nervous. Now, Flora had no very benignant
feelings towards the old lady&#8217;s long catalogue of imaginary
ailments; so she changed the dreaded subject, by inquiring after
the health of the old Captain, her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear, he&#8217;s just as well as ever,&#8212;nothing in the world
ever ails him; and little he cares for the sufferings of another.
This is a great day with him; he&#8217;s all bustle and fuss. Just step
to the window, and look at his doings. It&#8217;s enough to drive a
sensible woman mad. Talk of women wearing the <em>smalls</em>, indeed!
it&#8217;s a base libel on the sex. Captain Kitson is not content with
putting on my apron, but he appropriates my petticoats also. I
cannot give an order to my maid, but he contradicts it, or buy a
pound of tea, but he weighs it after the grocer. Now, my dear,
what would you do if the <em>Leaftenant</em> was like my husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; and Flora laughed heartily. &#8220;It must be
rather a trial of patience to a good housekeeper like you. But
what is he about?&#8221; she cried, stepping to the window that
overlooked a pretty lawn in front of the house, which commanded a
fine view of the sea. &#8220;He and old Kelly seem up to their eyes in
business. What an assemblage of pots and kettles, and household
stuff there is upon the lawn! Are you going to have an auction?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may well think so; if that were the case, there might be some
excuse for his folly. No;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> all this dirt and confusion, which once
a week drives me nearly beside myself, is what K&#8212;&mdash; calls
clearing up the ship; when he and his man Friday, as he calls
Kelly, turn everything topsy-turvy, and, to make the muddle more
complete, they always choose my washing-day for their frolic.
Pantries and cellars are rummaged over, and everything is dragged
out of its place, for the mere pleasure of making a litter, and
dragging it in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at the lawn! Covered with broken dishes, earless jugs,
cracked plates, and bottomless saucepans,&#8221; continued Mrs. Kitson.
&#8220;What a dish of nuts for my neighbours to crack! They always enjoy
a hearty laugh at my expense, on Kitson&#8217;s clearing-up days. But
what does he care for my distress? In vain I hide up all this old
trumpery in the darkest nooks in the cellar and pantry&#8212;nothing
escapes his prying eyes; and then he has such a memory, that if he
misses an old gallipot he raises a storm loud enough to shake down
the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last time he went to London,&#8221; pursued the old lady, &#8220;I
collected a vast quantity of useless trash, and had it thrown into
the pond behind the house. Well, when he cleared the decks next
time, if he did not miss the old broken crockery, all of which, he
said, he meant to mend with white lead on rainy days; while the
broken bottles, forsooth, he had saved to put on the top of the
brick wall, to hinder the little boys from climbing over to steal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the apples! Oh, dear, dear, dear! there was no end to his bawling,
and swearing, and calling me hard names, while he had the
impudence to tell Kelly, in my hearing, that I was the most
extravagant woman in the world. Now, <em>I</em>, that have borne him
seventeen children, should know something about economy and good
management; but he gives me no credit at all for that. He began
scolding again to-day, but my poor head could not stand it any
longer; so I came over to spend a few minutes with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The handsome old lady paused to draw breath, and looked so much
excited with this recapitulation of her domestic wrongs, that Mrs.
Lyndsay thought it not improbable she had performed her own part
in the scolding.</p>

<p>As to Flora, she was highly amused by the old Captain&#8217;s vagaries.
&#8220;By-the-bye,&#8221; she said, &#8220;had he any luck in shooting this morning?
He was out by sunrise with his gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady fell back in her chair, and laughed immoderately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shooting! Yes, yes, that was another frolic of his. But Kitson&#8217;s
an old fool, and I have told him so a thousand times. So you saw
him this morning with the gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I was afraid he might shoot Lyndsay, who was shaving at the
window. The captain pointed his gun sometimes at the window, and
sometimes at the eaves of the house, but as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> gun always missed
fire, I began to regain my courage, and so did the sparrows, for
they only chattered at him in defiance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And well they might. Why, my dear, would you believe it, he had
no powder in his gun! Now, Mrs. Lyndsay, you will perhaps think
that I am telling you a story, the thing is so absurd; yet I
assure you that it&#8217;s strictly true. But you know the man. When my
poor Nelly died, she left all her little property to her father,
as she knew none of her late husband&#8217;s relations&#8212;never was
introduced to one of them in her life. In her dressing-case he
found a box of charcoal for cleaning teeth, and in spite of all
that I could say or do, he insisted that it was <em>gunpowder</em>.
&#8216;Gunpowder!&#8217; says I, &#8216;what would our Nelly do with gunpowder?
It&#8217;s charcoal, I tell you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he smelt it, and smelt it&#8212;&#8216;&#8217;Tis gunpowder, Sally! Don&#8217;t
you think, that I know the smell of gunpowder? I, that was with
Nelson at Copenhagen and Trafalgar?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8217;Tis the snuff in your nose, that makes everything smell
alike;&#8217; says I. &#8216;Do you think, that our Nelly would clean her
beautiful white teeth with gunpowder?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why not?&#8217; says he; &#8216;there&#8217;s charcoal in gunpowder. And now,
Madam, if you dare to contradict me again, I will shoot you with
it, to prove the truth of what I say!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, after that, I held my tongue, though I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> did not choose to
give up. I thought to spite him, so for once I let him have his
own way. He spent an hour last night cleaning his old rusty gun;
and rose this morning by daybreak with the intention of murdering
all the sparrows. No wonder that the sparrows laughed at him. I
have done nothing but laugh ever since&#8212;so out of sheer revenge,
he proclaimed a cleaning day; and he and Kelly are now hard at
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was delighted with this anecdote of their whimsical
landlord; but before she could answer his better-half, the door
was suddenly opened and the sharp, keen face of the little officer
was thrust into the room.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><a name="III" id="III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE OLD CAPTAIN IN PERSON.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Mrs. Lyndsay</span>, my dear; that nurse of yours is going to hang out
your clothes in front of the sea. Now, it&#8217;s hardly <em>decent</em> of
her, to expose female garments to every boat that may be passing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Captain&#8217;s delicacy threw poor Flora nearly into convulsions of
laughter&#8212;while he continued, rather pettishly&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;She knows no more how to handle a rope than a pig. If you will
just tell her to wait a bit, until I have overhauled my vessel, I
will put up the ropes <a name="for" id="for"></a><ins title="fr in original">for</ins> you myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And hang out the clothes for you, Mrs. Lyndsay, if you will only
give him the treat&#8212;and then, he will not shock the sensitive
nerves of the sailors, by hanging them near the sea,&#8221; sneered the
handsome old lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to see things done in a lubberly manner,&#8221; muttered the old
tar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pray oblige him, Mrs. Lyndsay. He is such an old woman. I
wonder he does not ask your permission to let him wash the
clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;Fresh water is not my element, Mrs. Kitson, though I have long
known that <em>hot</em> water is yours. I never suffer a woman to touch
my ropes, and Mrs. Lyndsay borrowed those ropes this morning of
me. Don&#8217;t interrupt me, Mrs. K.; attend to your business, and
leave me to mine. Put a stopper upon that clapper of yours; which
goes at the rate of ten knots an hour&#8212;or look out for squalls.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the hope of averting the storm, which Flora saw was gathering
on the old man&#8217;s brow, and which in all probability had been
brewing all the morning, she assured the Captain, that he might
take the command of her nurse, ropes, clothes, and all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lyndsay,&#8212;you are a sensible woman,&#8212;which is more than I
can say of some folks,&#8221; glancing at his wife; &#8220;and I hope that you
mean to submit patiently to the yoke of matrimony; and not pull
one way, while your husband pulls the other. To sail well together
on the sea of life, you must hold fast to the right end of the
rope and haul in the same direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand was upon the lock of the door, and the old lady had made
herself sure of his exit, and was comfortably settling herself for
a fresh spell of gossip at his expense, when he suddenly returned
to the sofa on which Flora was seated; and putting his mouth quite
close to her ear, while his little inquisitive grey <a name="eyes" id="eyes"></a><ins title="esey in original">eyes</ins> sparkled
with intense curiosity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> said, in a mysterious whisper, &#8220;How is
this, my dear&#8212;I hear that you are going to leave us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora started with surprise. Not a word had transpired of the
conversation she had lately held with her husband. Did the old
Captain possess the gift of second-sight? &#8220;Captain Kitson,&#8221; she
said, in rather an excited tone; while the colour flushed up into
her face, &#8220;Who told you so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is true?&#8221; and the old fox rubbed his hands and nodded his
head, at the success of his stratagem. &#8220;Who told me?&#8212;why I can&#8217;t
say, who told me. You know, where there are servants living in the
house, and walls are thin&#8212;news travels fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when people have sharp ears to listen to what is passing in
their neighbours&#8217; houses,&#8221; muttered the old lady, in a provoking
aside, &#8220;news travels faster still.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was annoyed beyond measure at the impertinent curiosity of
the inquisitive old man. She felt certain that her conversation
with her husband had been overheard. She knew that Captain Kitson
and his wife were notable gossips, and it was mortifying to know
that their secret plans in a few hours would be made public. She
replied coldly, &#8220;Captain Kitson, you have been misinformed; we may
have talked over such a thing in private as a matter of
speculation, but nothing at present has been determined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear, that won&#8217;t do; leave an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> sailor to find out a
rat. I tell you that &#8217;tis the common report of the day. Besides,
is not the <em>Leaftenant</em> gone this morning with that scapegrace,
Tom W&#8212;&mdash;, to hear some lying land-shark preach about Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lecture! Kitson,&#8221; said the old lady, who was not a whit behind
her spouse in wishing to extract the news, though she suffered him
to be the active agent in the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lecture or preach, it&#8217;s all one; only the parson takes his text
from the Bible to hold forth upon, and these agents, employed by
the Canada Company, say what they can out of their own heads. The
object in both is to make money. I thought the <em>Leaftenant</em> had
been too long in a colony to be caught by chaff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband can judge for himself, Captain Kitson. He does not
need the advice, or the interference of a third person,&#8221; said
Flora, colouring again. And this time she felt really angry; but
there was no shaking the old man off.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure&#8212;to be sure,&#8221; said her tormentor, without taking the
smallest notice of her displeasure; &#8220;people are all wise in their
own eyes. But what is Canada to you, my dear? A fine settler&#8217;s
wife you will make; nervous and delicate, half the time confined
to your bed with some complaint or other. And then, when you are
well, the whole blessed day is wasted in reading and writing, and
coddling up the babby. I tell you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> that sort of business will not
answer in a rough country like Canada. I was there often enough
during the American war, and I know that the country won&#8217;t suit
you,&#8212;no, nor you won&#8217;t suit the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finding that Mrs. Lyndsay made no answer to this burst of
eloquence, he continued, in a coaxing tone&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, just for once in your life, my dear, be guided by older and
wiser heads than your own, and give up this foolish project
altogether. Let well alone. You are happy and comfortable where
you are. This is a nice cottage, quite large enough for your small
family. Fine view of the sea from these front windows, and all
ready furnished to your hand,&#8212;nothing to find of your own but
plate and linen; a pump, wood-house and coal-bin, and other
conveniences,&#8212;all under one roof. An oven&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; cried the old lady, &#8220;you need say nothing about that,
Kitson. The oven is good for nothing. It has no draught; and you
cannot put a fire into it without filling the house with smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; muttered the old man. &#8220;A little contrivance would soon
put that to rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried my best,&#8221; retorted the wife, &#8220;and I could never bake a
loaf of bread in it, fit to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all know what bad bread you make, Mrs. Kitson,&#8221; said the
captain. &#8220;I know that it can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> be baked in; so hold your tongue,
Madam! and don&#8217;t contradict me again. At any rate, there&#8217;s not a
smoky chimney in the house, which after all is a less evil than a
cross wife. The house, I say, is complete from the cellar to the
garret. And then, the rent&#8212;why, what is it? A mere trifle&#8212;too
cheap by one half,&#8212;only twenty-five pounds per annum. I don&#8217;t
know what possessed me, to let it so low; and then, my dear, the
privilege you enjoy in my beautiful flower-garden and lawn. There
is not many lodging-houses in the town could offer such
advantages, and all for the <em>paltry</em> consideration of twenty-five
pounds a-year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cottage is pretty, and the rent moderate, Captain,&#8221; said
Flora. &#8220;We have no fault to find, and you have not found us
difficult to please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am quite contented with my tenants; I only want them to
know when they are well off. Look twice before you leap
once&#8212;that&#8217;s my maxim; and give up this mad Canadian project,
which I am certain will end in disappointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this piece of disinterested advice, away toddled our
gallant naval commander, to finish with Kelly the arrangement of
his pots and kettles, and superintend the right adjustment of the
clothes-lines, and the hanging out of Mrs. Lyndsay&#8217;s clothes.</p>

<p>Do not imagine, gentle reader, that this picture is over-charged.
Captain Kitson is no creature of romance, (or was not, we should
rather say; for he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> has long since been gathered to his fathers);
but a brave, uneducated man; who during the war had risen from
before the mast to the rank of Post Captain. He had fought at
Copenhagen and Trafalgar, and distinguished himself in many a
severe contest on the main during those stirring times, and bore
the reputation of a dashing naval officer. At the advanced age of
eighty, he retained all his original ignorance and vulgarity; and
was never admitted into the society which his rank in the service
entitled him to claim.</p>

<p>The restless activity which in the vigour of manhood had rendered
him a useful and enterprising seaman, was now displayed in the
most ridiculous interference in his own domestic affairs, and
those of his neighbours. With a great deal of low cunning, he
mingled the most insatiable curiosity; while his habits were so
penurious, that he would stoop to any meanness to gain a trifling
pecuniary advantage for himself or his family.</p>

<p>He speculated largely in old ropes, condemned boats and sea-tackle
of all description, whilst as consul for the port, he had many
opportunities of purchasing wrecks of the sea, and the damaged
cargoes of foreign vessels, at a cheap rate; and not a stone was
left unturned by old Kitson, if by the turning a copper could be
secured.</p>

<p>The meddling disposition of the old Captain, rendered him the
terror of all the fishermen on the coast, over whom his sway was
despotic. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> superintended and ordered all their proceedings,
with an authority as absolute as though he were still upon the
deck of his war-ship, and they were subjected to his imperious
commands. Not a boat could be put off, or a flag hoisted, without
he was duly consulted and apprised of the fact. Not a funeral
could take place in the town, without Kitson calling upon the
bereaved family, and offering his services on the mournful
occasion, securing to himself by this simple man&#339;uvre, an
abundant supply of black silk cravats and kid gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never lose anything, my dear, for the want of <em>asking</em>,&#8221; he would
say. &#8220;A refusal breaks no bones, and there is always a chance of
getting what you ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>Acting upon this principle, he had begged favours of all the great
men in power; and had solicited the interest of every influential
person who had visited the town, during the bathing season, for
the last twenty years, on his behalf. His favourite maxim
practically carried out, had been very successful. He had
obtained, for the mere trouble of asking, commissions in the army
and navy for all his sons, and had got all his grandsons
comfortably placed in the Greenwich or Christ Church schools.</p>

<p>He had a garden too, which was at once his torment and his pride.
During the spring and summer months, the beds were dug up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
remodelled, three or four times during the season, to suit the
caprice of the owner, while the poor drooping flowers were ranged
along the grass-plot to wither in the sun during the process, and</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">&#8220;Waste their sweetness on the desert air.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">This he termed putting his borders into ship-shape.</p>

<p>The flower-beds which skirted the lawn, a pretty grass plot
containing about an acre of ground, surrounded by tall poplar
trees, were regularly sown with a succession of annuals, all for
the time being of one sort and colour. For several weeks,
innumerable quantities of double crimson stocks flaunted before
your eyes, so densely packed, that scarcely a shade of green
relieved the brilliant monotony. These were succeeded by
larkspurs, and lastly by poppies, that reared their tall, gorgeous
heads above the low, white railing, and looked defiance on all
beholders.</p>

<p>Year after year presented the same spectacle, and pounds of
stocks, larkspur and poppy seeds, were annually saved by the
eccentric old man, to renew his floral show.</p>

<p>Tom W&#8212;&mdash;, who was enchanted with the Captain&#8217;s oddities, had
nick-named the marine cottage <em>Larkspur Lodge</em>.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> news of Lieutenant Lyndsay&#8217;s intended emigration spread like
wild-fire through the village, and for several days formed the
theme of conversation. The timid shrugged their shoulders, and
drew closer to their own cosy fire-sides, and preferred staying at
home to tempting the dangers of a long sea-voyage. The prudent
said, there was a <em>possibility</em> of success; but it was better to
take care of the little you had, than run the risk of losing it
while seeking for more.&#8212;The worldly sneered, and criticised, and
turned the golden anticipations of the hopeful and the benevolent
into ridicule, prophesying disappointment, ruin, and a speedy
return. Lyndsay listened to all their remarks, endeavoured to
combat unreasonable objections, and remove pre-conceived
prejudices; but as it was all labour thrown away, he determined to
abide by the resolution he had formed, and commenced making
preparations accordingly.</p>

<p>Flora, who, like many of her sex, was more guided by her feelings
than her reason, was terribly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> annoyed by the impertinent
interference of others, in what she peculiarly considered, her own
affairs. Day after day she was tormented by visitors, who came to
condole with her on the shocking prospects before her. Some of
these were kind, well-meaning people, who really thought it a
dreadful thing, to be forced, at the caprice of a husband, to
leave home, and all its kindred joys, for a rude uncultivated
wilderness like Canada. To such Flora listened with patience; for
she believed their fears on her account were genuine&#8212;their
sympathy sincere.</p>

<p>There was only one person in the whole town whose comments she
dreaded, and whose pretended concern she looked upon as a real
<em>bore</em>&#8212;this was Mrs. Ready, the wife of a wealthy merchant, who
was apt to consider herself the great lady of the place.</p>

<p>The dreaded interview came at last. Mrs. Ready had been absent on
a visit to London; and the moment she heard of the intended
emigration of the Lyndsays to Canada, she put on her bonnet and
shawl, and rushed to the rescue. The loud, double rat-tat-tat at
the door, announced an arrival of more than ordinary consequence.</p>

<p>&#8220;O!&#8221; sighed Flora, pushing away her desk, at which she was writing
letters of importance, &#8220;I know that knock!&#8212;that disagreeable Mrs.
Ready is come at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Ready enters the room, I may as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> well explain to the
reader, what sort of an intimacy existed between Flora Lyndsay and
Harriet Ready, and why the former had such a repugnance to a visit
from the last-mentioned lady.</p>

<p>Without the aid of animal magnetism (although we have no doubt
that it belongs to that mysterious science) experience has taught
us all, that there are some natures that possess certain repellent
qualities, which never can be brought into affinity with our
own&#8212;persons, whom we like or dislike at first sight, with a
strong predilection for the one almost amounting to love, with a
decided aversion to the other, which in some instances almost
merges into downright hate.</p>

<p>These two ladies had no attraction for each other: they had not a
thought or feeling in common; and they seldom met without a
certain sparring, which, to the looker-on, must have betrayed how
matters stood between them.</p>

<p>But why did they meet, if such were the case?</p>

<p>It would be true wisdom in all such repellent natures to keep
apart. Worldly prudence, and the conventional rules of society,
compel persons to hide these secret antipathies&#8212;nay, even to
present the most smiling exterior to those whom they often least
respect.</p>

<p>The fear of making enemies, of being thought ill-natured and
capricious, or even of making the objects of their aversion
persons of too much consequence, by keeping them aloof, are some
of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> reasons we have heard alleged for these acts of mental
cowardice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ready was a low-born woman, and Flora belonged to a very old
and respectable family. Mrs. Ready wished to rise a step higher in
the social scale, and, thinking that Flora might aid her ambitious
views, she had, after the first calls of ceremony had been
exchanged, clung to her with a pertinacity which all Mrs.
Lyndsay&#8217;s efforts to free herself had been unable to shake off.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ready was a woman of great pretensions, and had acquired an
influence among her own set by assuming a superiority to which, in
reality, she had not the slightest claim. She considered herself a
beauty&#8212;a wit&#8212;a person of extraordinary genius, and possessed of
great literary taste. The knowledge of a few botanical names and
scientific terms, which she sported on all occasions, had
conferred upon her the title of a learned woman; while she talked
with the greatest confidence of her acquirements. <em>Her</em>
paintings&#8212;<em>her</em> music&#8212;<em>her</em> poetry, were words constantly in her
mouth. A few wretched daubs, some miserable attempts at
composition, and various pieces of music, played without taste,
and in shocking bad time, constituted all her claims to literary
distinction. Her confident boasting had so imposed upon the good
credulous people among whom she moved, that they really believed
her to be the talented being she pretended.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>A person of very moderate abilities can be spiteful; and Mrs.
Ready was so censorious, and said when offended such bitter
things, that her neighbours tolerated her impertinence out of a
weak fear, lest they might become the victims of her slanderous
tongue.</p>

<p>Though living in the same house with her husband, whose third wife
she was, they had long been separated, only meeting at their
joyless meals. Mrs. Ready considered her husband a very stupid
animal, and did not fail to make both him and her friends
acquainted with her opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a fate in these things,&#8221; she observed, &#8220;or you would
never see a person of <em>my</em> superior intellect united to a creature
like <em>that</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The world recognised a less important agency in the ill-starred
union. Mrs. Ready was poor, and had already numbered thirty years,
when she accepted the hand of her wealthy and despised partner.</p>

<p>No wonder that Flora, who almost adored her husband, and was a
woman of simple habits and pretensions, should dislike Mrs. Ready:
it would have been strange indeed if persons so differently
constituted, could have met without antagonism.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ready&#8217;s harsh unfeminine voice and manners; her assumption of
learning and superiority, without any real title to either, were
very offensive to a proud sensitive mind, which rejected with
disdain the patronage of such a woman. Flora had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> too much
self-respect, not to say <em>vanity</em>, to tolerate the insolence of
Mrs. Ready. She had met all her advances towards a closer intimacy
with marked coldness; which, instead of repelling, seemed only to
provoke a repetition of the vulgar, forcing familiarity, from
which she intuitively shrank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lyndsay,&#8221; she was wont to say, when that lady was absent,
&#8220;is a young person of some literary taste, and with the advice and
assistance of a friend (herself of course) she may one day become
an accomplished woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyndsay was highly amused at the league, offensive and defensive,
carried on by his wife and Mrs. Ready, who was the only <em>blue
stocking</em> in the place; and he was wont to call her Flora&#8217;s Mrs.
<em>Grundy</em>.</p>

<p>But <em>Mrs. Grundy</em> is already in the room, and Flora has risen to
meet her, and proffer the usual meaningless salutations of the
day. To these her visitor returns no answer, overwhelmed as she is
with astonishment and grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lyndsay!&#8221; she exclaimed, sinking into the easy chair placed
for her accommodation, and lifting up her hands in a tragic
ecstasy&#8212;&#8220;Is it true&#8212;true, that you are going to leave us? I
cannot believe it; it is so absurd&#8212;so ridiculous&#8212;the idea of
your going to Canada. Do tell me that I am misinformed; that it is
one of old Kitson&#8217;s idle pieces of gossip; for really I have not
been well since I heard it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>&#8221;Mrs. Ready paused for breath, and applied her handkerchief to her
eyes.</p>

<p>Flora remained silent and embarrassed. What could she say? She
placed no confidence in the grief of the weeping lady, and
despised the affectation of her tears&#8212;till she gasped forth&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not leave me in suspense; I would rather hear the truth at
once. Are you really going to Canada?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so. That is, if no untoward circumstances arise to
prevent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8212;And you can regard such a dreadful event with such
stoical indifference? Why does not your mother exert her
authority, to make you give up such a mad project?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother would never interfere with my husband&#8217;s wishes,
particularly when she considers them reasonable, and knows that no
real objections can be offered on the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But think of the dreadful sacrifice!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such sacrifices are made every day. Emigration, Mrs. Ready, is a
matter of necessity, not of choice. Mr. Lyndsay thinks it
necessary for us to take this step, and I have no doubt that he is
right. Did I consult my own feelings, I should certainly prefer
staying at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you would, and you affect this unconcern on purpose to
hide an aching heart. My dear, you cannot deceive me; I see
through it all. I pity you, my sweet friend; I sympathise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> with
you, from my very soul; I know what your <em>real</em> feelings are; I
can realize it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora remained silent. She certainly did wish that Mrs. Ready
occupied any other place in the United Kingdom at that moment than
the comfortable seat in her easy chair. But what could she do? She
could not inform the lady that she was tired of her company, and
wished to be alone. That would be considered an act of
ill-breeding of the most flagrant description; in common courtesy
she was compelled to act a lie.</p>

<p>Rather irritated at the small impression her eloquence had made
upon her companion, Mrs. Ready removed the cambric screen from her
face, on which not a trace of grief could be found, and clasping
her hands vehemently together, continued,&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband is mad, to draw you away from all your friends at a
moment&#8217;s warning! I would remonstrate&#8212;I would not go; I would
exert a proper spirit, and force him to abandon this Quixotic
expedition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak hastily, Mrs. Ready. Why should I attempt to prevent an
undertaking in which I most cordially concur, and which Mr.
Lyndsay thinks would greatly benefit his family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! I hate, I repudiate such passive obedience, as beneath
the dignity of woman! I am none of your soft bread-and-butter
wives, who consider it their <em>duty</em> to become the mere <em>echo</em> of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
their husbands. If <em>I</em> did not wish to go, no tyrannical lord of
the creation, falsely so called, should compel me to act against
my inclinations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Compulsion is not necessary: on this subject we both agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I see how it is!&#8221; with a contemptuous curl of the lip,
&#8220;you aspire to the character of a good, dutiful wife,&#8212;to become
an example of enduring patience to all the refractory conjugals in
the place, myself among the rest. I understand it all. How
<em>amiable</em> some people can be at the expense of others!&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was thunderstruck. &#8220;Indeed, Mrs. Ready, I meant no
reflection upon you. My words had no personal meaning; I never
talk <em>at</em> any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly not! You are not aware,&#8221; with a strong sneer, &#8220;of
the differences that exist between Mr. Ready and me (and which
will continue to exist, as long as mind claims a superiority over
matter); that we are only husband and wife in name. But I forgive
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have nothing to forgive, Mrs. Ready,&#8221; said Flora,
indignantly; &#8220;I never trouble my head with your private
affairs&#8212;they cannot possibly concern me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This gave rise to a scene. Mrs. Ready, who lived in an element of
strife, delighted in scenes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she continued, eagerly clutching at Flora&#8217;s last words,
&#8220;you are <em>too</em> selfishly engrossed with your own happiness to have
the least sympathy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> for the sorrows of a friend. Ah, well!&#8212;It&#8217;s
early days with you <em>yet</em>! Let a few short years of domestic care
pass over your head, and all this honey will be changed to gall.
Matrimony is matrimony, and husbands are husbands, and wives will
strive to have their own way&#8212;ay, and will fight to get it too.
You will then find, Mrs. Lyndsay, that very little of the sugar of
love, and all such romantic stuff, remains to sweeten your cup;
and in the bitterness of your soul, you will think of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If this is true,&#8221; said Flora, &#8220;who would marry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true in my case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But fortunately there are exceptions to every rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8212;This is another compliment, Mrs. Lyndsay, at my expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ready, I do not wish to quarrel with you; but you seem
determined to take all my words amiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long silence ensued,&#8212;Mrs. Ready smoothed down her ruffled
plumes, and said, in a pitying, patronising tone, very common to
her&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be disgusted with Canada: we shall see you back in less
than twelve months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very likely, if I know anything of John and myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do for society?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora thought, solitude would be a luxury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> and Mrs. Ready
away&#8212;and she answered, carelessly, &#8220;We must be content with what
Providence sends us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but you may be miles from any habitation. No church&#8212;no
schools for the children&#8212;no markets&#8212;no medical attendant&#8212;and
with your poor health&#8212;think of that, Mrs. Lyndsay! And worse, far
worse, no friends to sympathise and condole with you, in distress
and difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Flora was answering all these objections in her own mind; and,
quite forgetful of Mrs. Ready&#8217;s presence, she unconsciously
uttered her thoughts aloud&#8212;&#8220;These may be evils, but we shall at
least be spared the annoyance of disagreeable visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Imprudent Flora&#8212;to think aloud before such a woman as Mrs. Ready.
Who will venture to excuse such an eccentric proceeding? Would not
the whole world blame you for your incorrigible blunder? It had,
however, one good effect. It quickly cleared the room of your
intrusive guest; who swept out of the apartment with a haughty
&#8220;Good morning.&#8221; And well she might be offended; she had
accidentally heard the truth, which no one else in the town dared
have spoken boldly out.</p>

<p>Flora was astonished at her want of caution. She knew, however,
that it was useless to apologise; and she felt perfectly
indifferent as to the result; for she did not care, if she never
saw Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> Ready again; and such a decided affront would render
that event something more than doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank heaven! she is gone,&#8221; burst heartily from her lips, when
she found herself once more alone.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Mrs. Lyndsay to contemplate leaving England
without great pain. The subject was so distressing to her
feelings, that she endeavoured to forget it as much as she could.
The manner in which it had been forced upon her by Mrs. Ready, was
like probing a deep wound with a jagged instrument; and after that
lady&#8217;s departure, she covered her face with her hands, and wept
long and bitterly.</p>

<small>THE TRUE FRIEND.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Flora Lyndsay</span> was aroused from the passionate indulgence of grief
by two arms being passed softly around her neck, and some one
pulling her head gently back upon their shoulder, and kissing her
forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flora,&#8221; whispered a sweet, gentle woman&#8217;s voice; &#8220;Dear Flora. I
am come home at last. What, no word of welcome? No kiss for Mary?
In tears, too. What is the matter? Are you ill? Is the baby ill?
No&#8212;she at least is sleeping sweetly, and looks full of rosy
health. Do speak, and tell me the meaning of all this!&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was in the arms of her friend before she had ceased
speaking. &#8220;A thousand welcomes! dear Mary. You are the very person
I most wished just now to see. The very sight of you is an
antidote to grief. &#8216;A remedy for sore eyes,&#8217; as the Irish say.
You have been too long away. When did you arrive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the mail&#8212;about an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your dear sister&#8212;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is gone to a happier home,&#8221; said Mary Parnell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> in a faltering
voice; and glancing down at her black dress, she continued, &#8220;she
died happy&#8212;so happy, dear Flora, and now&#8212;she is happier still.
But, we will not speak of her just now, Flora; I cannot bear it.
Time, which reconciles us to every change, will teach me
resignation to the Divine will. But ah! &#8217;tis a sore trial to part
with the cherished friend and companion of our early years. We
were most attached sisters. Our hearts were one&#8212;and now&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Both friends wept. Mary first regained her
composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is Lyndsay? Has he finished writing his book?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The book is finished, and accepted by Mr. Bentley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good, excellent news; and the darling baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Dormouse. There she lies at the end of the sofa, covered
by my shawl. She has been sleeping ever since breakfast. I think
she only wakes up to amuse papa. But she is beginning to stretch
herself, and here comes the head-nurse himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our dear Mary, returned!&#8221; cried Lyndsay, entering the room. &#8220;It
seems an age since you left us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a melancholy separation to me,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;This
parting I hope will be the last. My father has consented to come
and live with my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> brother; and now that dear Emily is gone, I
shall have no inducement to leave home, so you will have me all to
yourselves, whenever I can steal an hour from my domestic duties;
and we shall once more be so happy together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyndsay looked at Flora, but neither spoke. Mary saw in a moment
that there was some hidden meaning in that quick, intelligent
glance; and she turned anxiously from one to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;What mischief have you been plotting, during my absence?&#8221; cried
the affectionate girl, taking a hand of each. &#8220;Some mystery is
here&#8212;I read it in your eyes. I come to you striving to drown the
remembrance of my own heavy sorrow, that we might enjoy a happy
meeting: I find Flora in tears, and you, Lyndsay, looking grave
and melancholy. What does it all mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has not Flora told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Told me what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That we are about to start for Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! no. This is sad news&#8212;worse than I expected. But are you
really determined upon going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our preparations are almost completed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse and worse. I hoped it might be only the whim of the
moment&#8212;a castle, not of the air, but of the woods&#8212;and as easily
demolished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us draw back,&#8221; said Flora. &#8220;Lyndsay, dearest; the trial is
too great.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too late now, Flora. Depend upon it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> love, that God has
ordered it, and that we act in conformity to the Divine will, and
that all is for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If such is your belief, my dear friend,&#8221; said Miss Parnell, &#8220;far
be it from me to persuade you to stay. God orders all things for
good. The present moment is the prophet of the future. It must
decide your fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not acted hastily in this matter,&#8221; returned Lyndsay. &#8220;I
have pondered over it long and anxiously, and I feel that my
decision is right. The grief poor Flora feels at parting with her
friends, is the greatest drawback. I thought that she possessed
more strength of endurance. As for me, I have passed through the
ordeal before, when I left Scotland for the Cape of Good Hope; and
I now look upon myself as a citizen of the world. I know that
Flora will submit cheerfully to the change, when once we lose
sight of the British shores.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This then means the cause of Flora&#8217;s tears?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; said Flora, laughing. &#8220;That odious Mrs. Ready has
been here, tormenting me with impertinent questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flora, I&#8217;m ashamed of you,&#8221; said Lyndsay, &#8220;for suffering yourself
to be annoyed by that stupid woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And worse than that, dear John, I got into a passion, and
affronted her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did <em>Mrs. Grundy</em> say?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&#8220;Ah! it&#8217;s fine fun for you. But if you had been baited by her for
a couple of hours, as I was, you could not have stood it much
better than I did. Why, she had the impudence to insist upon my
acting in direct opposition to your wishes; and all but insinuated
that I was a fool not to take her advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very serious offence, indeed,&#8221; said Lyndsay, laughing.
&#8220;Instigating my wife to an act of open rebellion. But I am sure
you will not profit by her example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, no! She&#8217;s the very last woman in the world I should wish
to imitate. Still I feel angry with myself for letting my temper
get the better of prudence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity, Flora, that you did not fight it out. I would back
my good wife against twenty Mrs. Grundys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would scratch my eyes out, and then write a horrid sonnet to
celebrate the catastrophe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody would read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but she would read it to everybody, and bore the whole town
with her lamentations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her go, Flora. I am tired of <em>Mrs. Grundy</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I was glad enough to get rid of her, which reconciles me
to the disagreeable manner in which I offended her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us talk of your Canadian plans,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;When do you
go?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;In three weeks,&#8221; said Lyndsay.</p>

<p>&#8220;So soon! The time is too short to prepare one to part with
friends so dear. If it were not for my poor old father, I would go
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a blessing it would be!&#8221; said Lyndsay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! do go, dear Mary,&#8221; cried Flora, quite transported at the
thought; and flinging her arms about her friend&#8217;s neck. &#8220;It would
make us so happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible!&#8221; said the dear Mary, with a sigh. &#8220;I spoke
without thinking. My heart will follow you across the Atlantic;
but duty keeps me here. I will not, however, waste the time still
left to us in useless regrets. Love is better shown by deeds than
words. I can work for you, and cheer you, during the last days of
your sojourn in your native land. Employment, I have always found,
by my own experience, is the best remedy for aching hearts.&#8221;</p>

<small>FLORA&#8217;S OUTFIT.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Having</span> once matured his plans, Lyndsay hastened to take the
necessary steps to carry them into execution. Leaving Flora and
her friend Mary to prepare all the indispensables for the voyage,
he hurried to London, to obtain permission from head-quarters to
settle in Canada, to arrange pecuniary matters for the voyage, and
take leave of a few old and tried friends. During his absence,
Flora and her friend were not idle. The mornings were devoted to
making purchases, and the evenings to convert them into articles
for domestic use. There were so many towels to hem, sheets to
make, and handkerchiefs and stockings to mark, that Flora saw no
end to the work, although assisted by kind sisters, and the
indefatigable Mary.</p>

<p>The two friends held a grand consultation over Flora&#8217;s scanty
wardrobe, in which there were articles &#8220;old and new;&#8221; but it must
be confessed that the old and the unfashionable predominated over
the new and well-cut. Flora&#8217;s friends were poor, and she had been
obliged to dispense with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> wedding outfit. An old and very rich
relation of her father had presented her with a very elegant
wedding-dress, shawl, and bonnet, which was all the finery Flora
possessed. Her other dresses were very plain, and composed of
common materials; and if it had not been for the unexpected bounty
of the said rich lady, our bride must have done without a
wedding-garment at all; for she had earned the few common
necessaries she took with her to housekeeping with her own hand,
in painting trifles for the bazaars, and writing articles for
ladies&#8217; magazines. One small trunk contained Flora&#8217;s worldly goods
and chattels, the night she entered the neatly-furnished lodgings
which Lyndsay had prepared for her as his wife.</p>

<p>Flora felt almost ashamed of the little she possessed; but her
high-minded, generous husband took her penniless as she was, and
laughingly assured her that they could never quarrel on the score
of riches; for his wardrobe was nearly as scanty as her own; and,
beyond a great chest of books and music, he had nothing in the
world but his half-pay. Many a long afternoon Flora spent during
her quiet honeymoon (for the month was April, and the weather very
wet) in looking over shirts and socks, and putting them into the
best habitable repair. She was thus employed, when an author of
some distinction called upon them, to enjoy half-an-hour&#8217;s chat.
Flora hid up her work as fast as she could; but in her hurry,
unfortunately,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> upset her work-basket on the floor, and all the
objectionable garments tumbled out at her guest&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>He was young, unmarried and a poet; and this certainly was not a
poetical incident. &#8220;Mrs. Lyndsay,&#8221; he cried, in a tragic
horror&#8212;(it would have been more in good taste to have said
nothing about it)&#8212;&#8220;Are you forced to devote your valuable time to
mending old socks and shirts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were meant for my <em>private</em> hours,&#8221; said Flora, laughing, as
she collected the fallen articles, and stowed them once more into
their hiding-place. &#8220;With <em>such</em> the public has nothing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if ever I marry, I&#8217;ll take good care to give away every old
thing I have in the world. No wife of mine shall have it to say
that she was forced to mend my rags.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till the time comes,&#8221; said Flora quietly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know
what may happen yet. There are more disagreeable things in
every-day life than mending old clothes. Industry and perseverance
may soon replace these with new ones; but it is useless to throw
away old friends until we are sure of obtaining others as good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora had often thought of this scene, and in her overflowing
happiness had blessed God that she had been permitted to share
Lyndsay&#8217;s poverty. Mending the old clothes had become a privilege.</p>

<p>Thirty pounds was all that she could now afford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> to lay out upon
herself and her little one. A small sum, indeed, to the rich, who
would have expended as much in a single article of dress, but very
large in her estimation, whose wants had always been regulated
more by the wants of others than her own.</p>

<p>Ignorant of the nature of the colony to which she was about to
emigrate, and of the manners and customs of the people among whom
she was to find a new home, and of whom she had formed the most
laughable and erroneous notions, many of her purchases were not
only useless, but ridiculous. Things were overlooked, which would
have been of the greatest service; while others could have been
procured in the colony for less than the expense of
transportation.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, the idea of anything decent being required in a
barbarous desert, such as the woods of Canada, was repudiated as
nonsense.</p>

<p>This reminds one of a gentleman who sent his son, a wild,
extravagant, young fellow, with whom he could do nothing at home,
to grow tame, and settle down into a quiet farmer in the
Backwoods. The experiment proved, as it always does in such cases,
a perfect failure. All parental restraint being removed, the young
man ran wild altogether, and used his freedom as fresh occasion
for licentiousness. The prudent father then wrote out to the
gentleman to whose care the son had been consigned, that he had
better buy him a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> wild farm, and a <em>negro and his wife</em> to keep
house for him.</p>

<p>This, too, after the passing of the Anti-Slavery bill! But, even
if slaves had been allowed in the colony, the horror of <em>colour</em>
is as great among the native-born Canadians as it is in the United
States. So much did this otherwise clever man know of the colony
to which he sent his unmanageable son!</p>

<p>Flora had been led to imagine that settlers in the Backwoods lived
twenty or thirty miles apart, and subsisted upon game and the wild
fruits of the country until their own lands were brought into a
state of cultivation. Common sense and reflection would have
pointed this out as impossible; but common sense is very rare, and
the majority of persons seldom take the trouble to think. We have
known many persons just as wise as Flora in this respect. It is a
fact, however, that Flora believed these reports, and fancied that
her lot would be cast in one of those remote settlements, where no
sounds of human life were to meet her ears, and the ringing of her
husband&#8217;s axe alone awake the echoes of the forest.</p>

<p>She had yet to learn, that the proximity of fellow-labourers in
the great work of clearing is indispensable; that man cannot work
alone in the wilderness, where his best efforts require the aid of
his fellow-men.</p>

<p>The oft-repeated assertion, that <em>anything would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> do for Canada</em>,
was the cause of more blunders in the choice of an outfit, than
the most exaggerated statements in its praise.</p>

<p>Of the fine towns and villages, and the well-dressed population of
the improved districts of the Upper Province, she had not formed
the slightest conception. To her fancy, it was a vast region of
cheerless forests, inhabited by unreclaimed savages, or rude
settlers doomed to perpetual toil,&#8212;a climate of stern
vicissitudes, alternating between intense heat and freezing cold,
and which presented at all seasons a gloomy picture. No land of
Goshen, no paradise of fruits and flowers, rose in the distance to
console her for the sacrifice she was about to make. The ideal was
far worse than the reality.</p>

<p>Guided by these false impressions, she made choice of articles of
dress too good for domestic drudgery, and not fine enough to suit
the rank to which she belonged. In this case, extremes would have
suited her better than a middle course.</p>

<p>Though fine clothes in the Backwoods may be regarded as useless
lumber, and warm stuffs for winter, and good washing calicoes for
summer, are more to be prized than silks and satins, which a few
days&#8217; exposure to the rough flooring of a log-cabin would
effectually destroy; yet it is absolutely necessary to be well
dressed when visiting the large towns, where the wealthier classes
not only dress well, but expensively.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>In a country destitute of an hereditary aristocracy, and where the
poorest emigrant, by industry and prudence, may rise to wealth and
political importance, the appearance which individuals make, and
the style in which they live, determine their claims to
superiority with the public, chiefly composed of the same elements
with themselves. The aristocracy of England may be divided into
three distinct classes,&#8212;that of family, of wealth, and of
talent,&#8212;all powerful in their order. The one which ranks the last
should hold its place with the first, for it originally produced
it; and the second, which is far inferior to the last, is likewise
able to buy the first. The heads of old families are more tolerant
to the great men of genius than they are to the accumulators of
riches; and a wide distinction is made by them between the
purse-proud millionaire and the poor man of genius, whose refined
tastes and feelings are more in unison with their own.</p>

<p>In Canada, the man of wealth has it all his own way; his dollars
are irresistible, and the money makes the man. Fine clothes are
there supposed to express the wealth of the possessor; and a
lady&#8217;s gown determines her right to the title, which, after all,
presents the lowest claims to gentility. A runaway thief may wear
a fashionably cut coat, and a well-paid domestic flaunt in silks
and satins.</p>

<p>Now, Flora knew nothing of all this; and she committed a great
error in choosing neat and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> respectable every-day clothing. The
handsome, and the very ordinary, would have answered her purpose
much better.</p>

<p>If &#8220;necessity is the mother of invention,&#8221; experience is the
handmaid of wisdom, and her garments fit well. Flora was as yet a
novice to the world and its ways. She had much to learn from a
stern and faithful preceptress, in a cold, calculating school.</p>

<small>HOW MISS WILHELMINA CARR AND FLORA BECAME ACQUAINTED.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many persons who called upon Flora to talk over her
projected emigration was a Miss Wilhelmina Carr&#8212;a being so odd,
so wayward, so unlike the common run of mortals, that we must
endeavour to give a slight sketch of her to our readers. We do not
possess sufficient artistic skill to do Miss Wilhelmina justice;
for if she had not actually lived and walked the earth, and if we
had not seen her with our own eyes, and heard her with our own
ears, we should have considered her a very improbable, if not an
impossible, variety of the human species feminine. We have met
with many absurd people in our journey through life, but a more
eccentric individual never before nor since has come under our
immediate observation.</p>

<p>Flora&#8217;s means were far too limited for her to entertain company.
Her visitors were confined entirely to her own family, and a few
old and chosen friends, with whom she had been intimate from
childhood. How, then, did she become acquainted with this lady?
Oddly enough; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> everything connected with Miss Carr was odd,
and out of the common way.</p>

<p>There was a mystery, too, about Miss Carr, which had kept the
gossips busy for the last four months, and clever and prying as
they were&#8212;quite models in their way&#8212;not one of them had been
able to come at the solution of the riddle.</p>

<p>One hot day during the preceding summer, Miss Wilhelmina walked
into the town, wearing a man&#8217;s broad-brimmed straw hat, and
carrying a cane in her hand, with a very small dog trotting at her
heels. She inquired at the first hotel in the town for lodgings,
and hired two very handsome apartments of Mrs. Turner, who kept
very respectable lodgings, and was patronised by the best families
in the neighbourhood. Miss Wilhelmina paid three months&#8217; rent in
advance; she brought no servant, and was to find her own table,
engaging Mrs. Turner to cook and wait upon her.</p>

<p>Some days after her arrival, two large travelling trunks, and
several well-filled hampers full of wine of the best quality, were
forwarded to her direction, and Miss Carr became one of the lions
of the little watering-place.</p>

<p>Who she was, or from what quarter of the world she emanated,
nobody could find out. She had evidently plenty of money at her
command, lived as she liked and did what she pleased, and seemed
perfectly indifferent as to what others thought of her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Her eccentric appearance attracted general attention, for she was
no recluse, and spent most of her time in the open air. If your
walk lay along the beach, the common, or the dusty high-road, you
were sure to meet Miss Carr and her dog at every turn.</p>

<p>The excitement regarding her was so great, that most of the ladies
called upon her in the hope of gratifying their curiosity, and
learning something about her from her own lips. In this they were
quite disappointed, for Miss Wilhelmina Carr, though she was
sitting at the window nursing her dog, did not choose to be at
home to any one, and never had the courtesy to return these
ceremonious visits. An old practised propagator of news waylaid
Mrs. Turner in the street, and cross-questioned her in the most
dexterous manner concerning her mysterious lodger; but the good
woman was either seized with a fit of unusual prudence, or, like
Horace Smith&#8217;s mummy&#8212;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">&#8220;Was sworn to secrecy.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">There was no getting anything out of her beyond the
astounding facts, that Miss Carr smoked out of a long pipe, drank
brandy-punch, and had her table served with all the dainties of
the season. &#8220;Besides all this,&#8221; whispered the cautious Mrs.
Turner, &#8220;she swears like a man.&#8221; This last piece of information
might be a scandal, the ladies hoped that it was, but believed and
talked about it as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> shocking thing, if true, to all their
acquaintance, and congratulated themselves that the dreadful woman
had shown her wisdom in not returning the visits of respectable
people.</p>

<p>The person about whom all this fuss was made, was a tall, and very
stout woman of fifty years of age; but active and energetic
looking for her time of life. Her appearance was eccentric enough
to afford ample scope for all the odd sayings and doings in
circulation respecting her. She had a satirical, laughing, jolly
red face, with very obtuse features; and, in order to conceal hair
of a decidedly carroty hue, she wore an elaborately curled flaxen
wig, which nearly covered her large forehead, and hung over her
eyes like the curly coat of a French poodle dog. This was so
carelessly adjusted, that the red and flaxen formed a curious
shading round her face, as their tendrils mingled and twined
within each other. Her countenance, even in youth, must have been
coarse and vulgar; in middle life, it was masculine and decidedly
ugly, with no redeeming feature, but the large good-natured mouth,
well set with brilliantly white teeth&#8212;strong, square, even teeth,
that seem to express their owner&#8217;s love of good cheer; and
silently intimated, that they had no light duty to perform, and
were made expressly for eating.</p>

<p>Miss Carr, though she sported a man&#8217;s hat and carried a cane,
dressed expensively, her outer garments being made of the richest
materials; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> she wore these so ridiculously short, that her
petticoats barely reached below the middle of her legs; leaving
exposed to general observation, the only beauty she possessed&#8212;a
remarkably handsome and neatly made foot and ankle.</p>

<p>Now, we don&#8217;t believe that Miss Carr cared a fig about her
handsome legs and feet. If they had belonged to the regular
Mullingar breed, she would have shown them as freely to all the
world; simply, because she chose to do so. She was a great
pedestrian, to whom long petticoats would have been uncomfortable
and inconvenient.</p>

<p>If she was vain of anything, it was of her powers of locomotion.
She had made the tour of Europe on foot and alone, and still
continued to walk her ten or fourteen miles a day, let the weather
be what it would. Hail, rain, blow, or snow, it was all one to
Miss Carr. &#8220;She was walking,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to keep herself in
practice, as she was contemplating another long journey on foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ida Pfeiffer, the celebrated female traveller, was unknown in
those days; or Miss Carr might have taken the shine out of that
adventurous lady; as easily as the said Ida destroys all the
romantic notions previously entertained by stay-at-home
travellers, about the lands she visits, and the people who form
the subjects of her entertaining matter-of-fact books.</p>

<p>When Miss Carr made her <em>deb&#251;t</em> at church, with her masculine hat
placed resolutely on the top of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> her head, and cane in hand,
people could not say their prayers, or attend to the sermon, for
staring and wondering at the uncouth apparition which had so
unceremoniously appeared in the midst of them. This was not
diminished, by her choosing to stand during those portions of the
service, when pious females bend the knee. Miss Wilhelmina said,
&#8220;that she was too big to kneel&#8212;that her prayers were just as good
in one attitude as another. The soul had no legs or knees, that
she could discover&#8212;and if the prayers did not come from the
heart, they were of no use to her, or to any one else. She had not
much faith in prayers of any kind. She never could find out that
they had done her the least good, and if she had to go through a
useless ceremony, she would do it in the most convenient manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora had heard so much about this strange woman, that she had not
called upon her on her first arrival in the town, though it must
be confessed, that her curiosity was as much excited as her
neighbours&#8217;. In her walks to and fro from her mother&#8217;s house, who
resided within a short distance of the town, Flora had often
encountered the sturdy pedestrian stumping along at full speed,
and she had laughed heartily with her husband at her odd
appearance; at her short petticoats, and the resolute manner in
which she swung her cane, and planted it down upon the ground. She
had often wondered how such an elephant of a woman could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> move so
rapidly upon such small feet, which looked as if she had lost her
own, and borrowed a pair of some child by the way.</p>

<p>She was always followed in all her rambles by a diminutive
nondescript kind of dog&#8212;a tiny, long-haired, silky looking
creature, the colour of coffee freshly ground, no bigger than a
large squirrel, with brilliant black eyes, bushy tail, and a pert
little face, which greatly resembled that animal.</p>

<p>Often, when moving at full speed along the dusty highway, its
mistress would suddenly stop, vociferating at the top of her
voice&#8212;&#8220;Muff! Muff! where are you, my incomparable Muff?&#8221; when the
queer pet would bound up her dress like a cat, and settle itself
down upon her arm, poking its black nose into her hand, or rearing
up on its hind legs, to lick her face. They were an odd pair, so
unlike, so widely disproportioned in size and motion, that Flora
delighted in watching all their movements, and in drawing
contrasts between the big woman and her small four-footed
companion.</p>

<p>By some strange freak of fancy, Lyndsay and his wife had attracted
the attention of Miss Carr, who never passed them in her long
rambles without bestowing upon them a gracious bow and a smile,
which displayed, at one gesture, all her glittering store of
large, white teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe, John, the strange woman means to pick acquaintance
with us,&#8221; said Flora to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> husband, one fine afternoon during
the previous summer, as they were on their way to spend the
evening with her mother at &#8212;&mdash; Hall. &#8220;Instead of passing us at
her usual brisk trot, she has loitered at our pace for the last
half-hour, smiling at us, and showing her white teeth, as if she
were contemplating the possibility of an introduction. I wish she
would break the ice; for I am dying with curiosity to know
something about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very foolish,&#8221; said Lyndsay, who was not one of Miss
Carr&#8217;s admirers, &#8220;to trouble your head about her. These eccentric
people are often great bores; and, if you get acquainted with
them, it is not easy to shake them off. She may be a very
<em>improper</em> character. I hate mystery in any shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bless you!&#8221; said Flora, laughing: &#8220;she is too old and ugly
for scandal of that sort. I should think, from her appearance,
that she never had had a sweetheart in her life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no telling,&#8221; returned Lyndsay. &#8220;She may be lively and
witty. Odd people possess an attraction in themselves. We are so
much amused with them, that they fascinate us before we are aware.
She has a good figure for her very voluminous proportions, and
splendid trotters, which always possess charms for some men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t be censorious, husband dear. If she should speak to
us&#8212;what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer her civilly, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&#8220;And if she should take it into her head to call upon us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Return it, and let the acquaintance drop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora&#8217;s love of the ridiculous was her besetting sin. She
continued to watch the movements of Miss Carr with mischievous
interest, and was as anxious for an interview as Lyndsay was that
she should keep her distance. Flora pressed her hand tightly on
her husband&#8217;s arm, scarcely able to keep her delight in due
bounds, while she whispered, in a triumphant aside, &#8220;John, I was
right. She is shaping her course to our side of the road. She
means to speak to us,&#8212;and now for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyndsay looked annoyed. Flora with difficulty repressed her
inclination to laugh out, as Miss Carr came alongside, and
verified Mrs. Lyndsay&#8217;s prediction, by commencing the conversation
in a loud-toned, but rather musical voice,</p>

<p>&#8220;A bright afternoon for your walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautiful for the time of year,&#8221; said Flora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather hot for stout people like me. You seem to enjoy it
amazingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am fond of walking. I do not find the heat oppressive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; you are thin. Have not much bulk to carry; one of
Pharaoh&#8217;s lean kine. It requires a warm day to make your blood
circulate freely. I like winter and spring best for long rambles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you would prefer riding,&#8221; said Lyndsay; &#8220;yet I see
you out every day on foot.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>&#8220;I never ride: I hate and detest riding. I never could be
dependent upon the motions of an animal. Horses are my aversion;
jackasses I despise. God, when He gave us legs of our own,
doubtless intended us to make use of them. I have used mine ever
since I was a baby, and they are not worn out yet. I got upon my
feet sooner than most children, and have kept them to their duty
ever since. I am a great walker; I have been walking all my life.
Do you know that I have walked over Europe alone, and on foot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have heard,&#8221; said Lyndsay. &#8220;It must have been an arduous
undertaking for a lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Far easier than you imagine. Women are just as able to shift for
themselves as men, if they would follow my example, and make the
trial. I have scarcely sat still for the last twenty years. There
is not a remarkable spot in Europe that I have not visited, or
mountain but what I have climbed, or cavern that I have left
unexplored. Three years ago I commenced a pedestrian tour through
Great Britain, which I accomplished greatly to my own
satisfaction. When I take a fancy to a place, I stay in it until I
have explored all the walks in the neighbourhood. Directly I grow
tired, I am off. &#8217;Tis a happy, independent sort of life I lead.
Confinement would soon kill me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friends must feel very anxious about you,&#8221; said Flora,
&#8220;during your absence.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>&#8220;Friends! Fiddlesticks! Who told you I had any friends who care a
fig for me or my movements? I am gloriously independent, and mean
to remain so. There is but one person in the world who is related
to me in the most remote degree, or who dares to trouble their
head about me or my doings, and he is only a half brother. He has
opposed himself against my freedom of thought and action; but I
don&#8217;t care that&#8221;&#8212;(snapping her fingers vigorously)&#8212;&#8220;for him or
his opinions. He has made war upon my roaming propensities all his
life. As if a woman has not as much right to see the world as a
man, if she can pay her own expenses, and bear her own burthen,
without being a trouble to any one. It is certainly no business of
his how I spend my money, or where and how I pass my life. Not
long ago I heard that he was going to issue a writ of lunacy
against me, in order to get me and my property into his
possession. This is mean; for he very well knows that I am not
mad; and he is very rich, so that there is no excuse for his
avarice. Fortunately, he don&#8217;t know me personally&#8212;never saw me
since I was a child&#8212;and as I never go by my real name, it is not
a very easy matter for him to discover me. I don&#8217;t like this
place, but it is quiet and out of the way. I think I shall remain
where I am, till he gets tired of hunting me out. I trust to your
honour, young people; you must not betray my secret.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Both promised to say nothing about what she had so frankly
communicated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I take you at your word,&#8221; continued Miss Carr; &#8220;I like your
appearance, and would willingly improve my acquaintance. I often
watched you from my windows; and yesterday I asked Mrs. Turner who
you were. Her account was so much in your favour, that I
determined to introduce myself the first time we accidentally
encountered each other. I know your names and where you live. May
I come and occasionally enjoy an hour&#8217;s chat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall only be too happy,&#8221; said Flora, in spite of a warning
pinch from Lyndsay, which said, as plainly as words could have
done, &#8220;She&#8217;s mad; as mad as a March hare.&#8221; But Flora would not
understand the hint. She felt flattered by the confidence so
unexpectedly reposed in them by the odd creature; and vanity is a
great enemy to common sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind,&#8221; said Miss Wilhelmina, turning abruptly to Lyndsay, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to see you at my house. I&#8217;m a single woman, and, though
not very young, I&#8217;m very particular about my character. I never
allow a male creature to enter my doors. I&#8217;m not fond of men&#8212;I
have no reason to be fond of them. They never were commonly civil
to me; and I hate them generally and individually. When I come to
see your wife of course I don&#8217;t expect you to hide out of the way,
or peep at me through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> crannies, as if I were a wild beast. I
shall call to-morrow morning, and so, good day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Muff! Muff!&#8212;My incomparable! my perfect!&#8212;What are you doing?
Frisking beside that ugly black cur! He&#8217;s no companion for a dog
of your breeding and degree. Away, you vulgar-looking brute.&#8221; And
running across the road, she seized hold of a pedlar&#8217;s dog, who
was having a great game of romps with her favourite, and gave it a
most unjust and unmerciful belabouring with her cane.</p>

<p>The pedlar, who was by no means pleased with this outrage against
his cur, now interfered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lick my dorrg, ma&#8217;am, in that ere sort o&#8217; fashun. What harm
can that hanimal ha&#8217; done to you, or that whiskered cat-like thing
o&#8217; yourn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your impertinent tongue, fellow! or I&#8217;ll thrash you, too,&#8221;
cried Miss Wilhelmina, flourishing aloft her cane.</p>

<p>The man eyed her sullenly. &#8220;Maybe, you&#8217;d beest not try. If you
warn&#8217;t a &#8217;uman I&#8217;d give it to &#8217;un.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lady, sir,&#8221; with great dignity, and drawing herself up to her
full height.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies don&#8217;t act in that ere way. You be but a &#8217;uman, and a mad
yun, too; that be what you be&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next moment Lyndsay expected the cane to descend upon the
pedlar&#8217;s head, and was ready to rush to the rescue of the fair
Wilhelmina. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> no; the lady dropped her cane, burst into a loud
fit of laughter, stooped down, patted the offended cur, and,
slipping a shilling into the hand of the angry countryman,
snatched Muff to her capacious bosom, and walked off at full trot.</p>

<p>The pedlar, looking after her for a minute, with his eyes and
mouth wide open in blank astonishment, and then down at the silver
glittering in his hand, cried out,&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knows you bees a lady now. If you delights in licking o&#8217;
do&#8217;rrgs, ma&#8217;am, you ma&#8217; thrash Bull as much as you please for
sixpence a licking. That&#8217;s fair, I thinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>He might as well have shouted to the winds; Miss Wilhelmina was
out of hearing, and Flora and her husband pursued their walk to
the hall.</p>

<small>MISS WILHELMINA CALLS UPON FLORA.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> breakfast things were scarcely removed the following morning,
when Miss Carr walked into the room, where Flora was employed at
her work-table, in manufacturing some small articles of dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband is afraid of me, Mrs. Lyndsay: he started off the
moment he saw me coming up to the door. I don&#8217;t want to banish him
from his own house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not at all. He has business in town, Miss Carr. You have
favoured me with a very early visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too early? Just speak the truth plainly out. Why the deuce do
people tell so many stories, when it would be far easier to speak
the truth? I assure you, that you look so neat and comfortable in
your morning costume, that you have no reason to be ashamed. I
like to come upon people unawares,&#8212;to see them as they really
are. You are welcome to come and see me in my night-cap, when the
spirit moves me. When I&#8217;m not out walking, I&#8217;m always at home.
Busy at work, <a name="quote1" id="quote1"></a><ins title="missing &#8221; in original">too?&#8221;</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> she continued, putting a tiny cap upon her
fist. &#8220;That looks droll, and tells tales.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t!&#8212;do spare me,&#8221; cried Flora, snatching the article from
her odd companion, and hiding it away in the table-drawer. &#8220;I did
not mean that any one should catch me at this work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think, my dear, that I am going to criticise you. I am no
judge of sewing,&#8212;never set a stitch in my life. It must be a dull
way of spending time. Can&#8217;t you put your needle-work out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too poor for that? Mrs. Turner&#8217;s daughter takes in all such
gimcracks. Send what you&#8217;ve got over to her, and I&#8217;ll pay for the
making.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Carr!&#8221; said Flora, greatly distressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, angry again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not exactly angry; but you wound my pride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would do you no harm to kill it outright,&#8221; said Miss Carr,
laughing&#8212;such a loud, jovial peal of merriment, which rang so
clearly from her healthy lungs, that Flora, in spite of her
offended dignity, was forced to laugh too.</p>

<p>&#8220;You feel better now. I hope the proud fit is going off, and we
can enjoy a reasonable chat. These clothes&#8212;what a bore they are,
to both poor and rich,&#8212;the rich setting their heart too much upon
them, and the poor despised because they have not enough to keep
them warm,&#8212;and those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> mean and old. Then, this is not all. There
are the perpetual changes of the fashions, which oblige people to
put on what does not suit them, and to make monstrous frights of
themselves to dress in the mode. You must have a morning-gown, a
dinner-dress, and an evening costume; all to be shifted and
changed in the same day, consuming a deal of time, which might be
enjoyed in wholesome exercise. I have no patience with such folly.
The animals, let me tell you, are a great deal better off than
their masters. Nature has provided them with a coat which never
wants changing but once a-year; and that is done so gradually,
that they experience no inconvenience. No need of their consulting
the fashions, or patching and stitching to keep up a decent
appearance. It is a thousand pities that clothes were ever
invented. People would have been much healthier, and looked much
better without them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear madam, did not God himself instruct our first parents to
make garments of the skins of animals?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were not necessary in a state of innocence, or He would have
created them like cows and horses, with clothes upon their backs,&#8221;
said Wilhelmina, sharply. &#8220;It was their own fault that they ever
required such trumpery, entailing upon their posterity a curse as
bad as the thorns and thistles. For I always consider it as such,
when sweltering under the weight of gowns and petticoats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> on a hot
day; and I rate Mother Eve roundly, and in no measured terms, for
her folly in losing the glorious privilege of walking in buff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have been thinking of that,&#8221; said Flora, rather
mischievously, and glancing down at Miss Wilhelmina&#8217;s legs, &#8220;when
you cut your petticoats so short.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are welcome to laugh at any short petticoats,&#8221; said
Wilhelmina, &#8220;as long as I feel the comfort of wearing them. Now do
tell me, candidly,&#8212;what impropriety is there in a woman showing
her leg and foot, more than in another woman showing her hand and
arm? The evil lies in your own thoughts. You see the Bavarian
buy-a-broom girls passing before your windows every day, with
petticoats cut three or four inches shorter than mine. You
perceive no harm in that. &#8216;It is the fashion of her country,&#8217; you
cry. Custom banishes from our minds the idea of impropriety; and
the naked savage of the woods is as modest as the closely covered
civilian. Now, why am I compelled to wear long petticoats
drabbling in the mud, when a Bavarian may wear hers up to the
knees, and nobody think the worse of her? I am as much a free
agent as she is; have as much right to wear what I please. I like
short petticoats&#8212;I can walk better in them&#8212;they neither take up
the dust or the mud, and leave my motions free and
untrammelled&#8212;and what&#8217;s more, I mean to wear them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&#8220;I have tried trowsers; but they fettered me. It is difficult to
stow a large figure like mine away into trowsers. I felt as if my
legs were in the stocks, and kicked them off in disdain&#8212;simply
remarking&#8212;&#8216;what fools men are!&#8217; So, you don&#8217;t like my short
petticoats? and I hate your long ones. First, because they are
slatternly and inconvenient; secondly, because they make your
stockings dirty; and thirdly, because they give you the idea that
they are intended to conceal crooked legs. So don&#8217;t say one word
in their favour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is but a matter of taste and opinion,&#8221; said Flora; &#8220;we will
not quarrel about it. I think it wiser, however, in order to avoid
singularity, to conform to existing fashions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lyndsay, I can prove to you in less than two minutes, that
you transgress daily your own rules.&#8221; Flora looked incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not wear a <em>bustle</em>, which is now considered by all ladies
an indispensable article of dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right: it is a disgusting fashion, which destroys the
grace and just proportions of the female form. A monstrous piece
of absurdity, that I have never adopted, and never will.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noi"><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> During twenty years Flora kept her word.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Bravo! Bravo!&#8221; shouted Miss Wilhelmina, clapping her hands in an
ecstasy of delight. &#8220;I have conquered you with your own weapons.
There is no slipping past the horns of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> dilemma. You refuse
to wear a hump on your back, and I decline the honour of the long
petticoats. Let us hear how you can justify yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have gained an advantage by my own admission,&#8221; said Flora;
&#8220;but I can&#8217;t consider myself beat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fairly out of the field, my dear&#8212;fairly out of the field.
Acknowledge the defeat with a good grace. Let us shake hands, and
drink a glass of wine together in token of peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never keep wine in the house,&#8221; said Flora, rather embarrassed,
at the request, particularly at such an early hour of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never keep wine in your house! Why, how do you contrive to keep
up your spirits, without a glass of wine now and then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are young, and require no artificial stimulants, to render us
cheerful and happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I require stimulants,&#8221; said Miss Wilhelmina, &#8220;with the
violent exercise I take. I do not object to a glass of
brandy-and-water, or even of gin, when I feel exhausted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you feel ill, Miss Carr, I will send out and get some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ill! Lord bless you! I never was ill for an hour in my life. So,
you cannot afford a little luxury like wine? My child, I pity you:
I am sure you require it. I wish you were better off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never quarrel with Providence, from whom we have received
so many blessings, on that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> account,&#8221; said Flora; &#8220;I am very
grateful for the real comforts we enjoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor comfort!&#8221; quoth Miss Wilhelmina. &#8220;My ideas of comfort are
always associated with wealth. I maintain, that no one can really
be comfortable without it. What should I be, without money? An
antiquated, despised old maid&#8212;and with all my expensive habits,
and queer notions, the very boys in the village would hold me in
derision. For even boys know the importance of money, and let me
pass unmolested through the midst of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I perceive that you are very popular with the young folks,&#8221; said
Flora.</p>

<p>&#8220;All bribery and corruption, my dear. Boys are but men abridged
and cramped down into skeleton jackets. When I come to a town, I
throw a handful of small silver coin into the middle of the first
group of boys I find in my path. The next time they see me coming
they cry out lustily, &#8216;Off with your hats, boys: here comes the
rich lady!&#8217; Off go the tattered hats and caps, and my small coin
pays for the compliment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your plan is an expensive one,&#8221; said Flora; &#8220;no wonder the boys
regard you with such favour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never found money fail but in one instance,&#8221; said Miss
Wilhelmina thoughtfully. &#8220;Mind, it is not to every one that I
would communicate my experience. People like to talk of
themselves&#8212;to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> tell portions of their history; it relieves their
minds. There are very few to whom I have ever told mine; but I
think it will amuse you. The follies of others are always
entertaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father was Scotch&#8212;my mother Irish. The two nations don&#8217;t
amalgamate very well together. The children of such an union are
apt to inherit the peculiar national failings of both. My father
united to a love of science a great deal of mechanical genius. He
was a clever, prudent, enterprising man, and amassed a large
fortune. My mother I never knew&#8212;she died when I was an infant. My
father hired a good-natured, easy kind of woman, to be nurse. She
was a widow, without children, whom he afterwards promoted to the
head of his table. She was his third wife. He had one son by his
first marriage, who had been born in Scotland, and adopted by a
rich uncle. He afterwards got an appointment in India; and I never
saw him above half-a-dozen times in my life&#8212;and only when a
child. He was a handsome, proud man, very Scotch in all his words
and ways. We never took to one another. He thought me a spoilt,
disagreeable, pert child; and I considered him a cross, stern man;
and never could be induced to call him brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I inherited a good property from my mother, which made me a very
independent little lady, in my own conceit. I knew, that the
moment I became of age, I was my own mistress. Perhaps it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> was
this consciousness of power which made me the queer being I am.</p>

<p>&#8220;My step-mother was very fond of me. She spoilt me
shockingly&#8212;more than most mothers indulge their brats. She always
seemed to retain a sense of the inferior position she had held.
Not a common failing, by-the-by: persons raised unexpectedly to
wealth, from the lower class, generally measure their presumption
by their ignorance. She always treated me as a superior. My father
was very fond of her. These passive women are always great
favourites with men. They have no decided character of their own,
and become the mere echoes of superior minds. A vain man loves to
see his own reflection in one of these domestic magnifying
glasses: it is so gratifying to be the Alpha and Omega in his own
house. His former wives were both handsome, conceited women, who
thought so much of themselves that they could reflect no
perfections but their own. In this respect I resembled my
mother&#8212;from a baby I thought fit to have a will and opinions of
my own.</p>

<p>&#8220;My step-mother always yielded to my masterly disposition when a
child, generally ending the brief contest with the remark, &#8216;What
a pity Willie was not a boy! What a fine spirited boy she would
have made!&#8217; When I grew a tall girl, I became more independent
still, and virtually was mistress of the house. My father sent me
to school. I learnt quickly enough; but I was expelled from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> half
a dozen for striking my teacher whenever she dared to raise her
hand to correct me. At length my education was finished, and I
returned home for good, as wild and as fierce as an untamed colt.</p>

<p>&#8220;My step-mother had a nephew&#8212;a lad whom my father had befriended
very much. He had paid for his education, had bound him to an
eminent surgeon, and, when his term expired, had enabled him, from
the same source, to walk the hospitals and attend the necessary
lectures. Henry was attending the last course which was to fit him
for entering upon his profession; and during that period he made
our house his home.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not handsome, but a well-grown, high-spirited, clever
young fellow. Not at all a sentimental person, but abounding in
frolic and fun, full of quaint, witty sayings, and the very
incarnation of mischief. We took amazingly to each other; and he
enjoyed all my odd freaks and fancies, and encouraged me in all my
masculine propensities.</p>

<p>&#8220;I grew very fond of him: he was the only creature of his sex I
ever loved;&#8212;but I did love him, and I thought that he loved me. I
considered myself handsome and fascinating. All young people think
so, if they are ever so ordinary. It belongs to the vanity of the
age, which believes all things&#8212;hopes for all things, and
entertains no fears for the result.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;The girls at school had told me, that &#8216;I was a perfect fright;&#8217;
but I did not believe them. They laughed at my snub nose and
carrotty locks, and said &#8216;that it would take all my money to buy
me a husband.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, by way of digression, I&#8217;m a great talker, Mrs. Lyndsay, and
love to ramble from one subject to another. Do just tell me, why a
<em>snub</em> nose should be reckoned vulgar, and red hair disgraceful?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was an awkward question. It was, however, put point blank.
Flora could not avoid giving something in the shape of an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible to account for these things,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Any
deviation from a recognised standard of taste and beauty is always
open to objections. But there are a great many modifications of
these rules. Elegance of form, grace of manner, charms of
expression, and even sweetness of voice, will render plain persons
not only agreeable, but highly so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You reconcile me to my snub nose and red hair,&#8221; said the odd
woman. &#8220;But few people possess a nice sense of discrimination;
they are quick at finding out defects, slow at discovering graces.
The world is full of unjust partialities. My snub nose would have
been considered a beauty in Africa. My red hair would have been
admired in Italy; but there is no struggling against national
prejudices; and these bull-headed English are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> most prejudiced
animals under the sun&#8212;and I was remorselessly branded as a fright
by a pack of sneering girls, half of whom had noses as bad as my
own. I had my private opinion on the subject, in which I flattered
myself my cousin (as I called Henry), would perfectly agree.</p>

<p>&#8220;He never told me he loved me. I felt certain that he did, and
that it was gratitude to my father, for all that he had done for
him, which kept him silent. This was a foolishly romantic notion
of mine. But there was a touch of romance about me in those days.
I was green&#8212;very green. I can laugh at myself now. But it has
always been rather a sore subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henry did not speak himself. So I thought I would break the ice,
and speak for him. You look surprised. Well, I know it is not
exactly according to the general rules observed in such matters,
which ties a woman&#8217;s tongue, and obliges her to wait with all
humility, until she is asked by some man, whom perhaps she does
not care a fig for, to be his wife. I never lived within rules,
and I thought I had as much right to please myself, and ask a man
to marry me, as a man had to ask me to be his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made Henry an offer of my hand, heart, and fortune&#8212;and&#8212;it is
no use being ashamed at my time of life, of a thing which happened
such a long time ago&#8212;I was <em>refused</em>!&#8212;without any softening of
the matter&#8212;down right, positively refused.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&#8220;The ungrateful varlet did not even thank me for the honour. He
briefly told me, &#8216;That I was a very amusing girl, but the last
woman on earth he should wish to make his wife; that as to money,
it was certainly a great inducement, but not enough to compensate
for the sacrifice of his principles. He had a good profession, and
hoped to earn by it wealth and independence.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! how I hated him while he told me all this. How I have hated
all his sex from that hour, for his sake!</p>

<p>&#8220;However, my dear, it had this good effect,&#8212;it cured me of all
such ridiculous weakness then and for ever. I shook off the love
fit, and Wilhelmina was herself again.</p>

<p>&#8220;My step-mother died shortly after this, and I became the mistress
of my father&#8217;s house. He was old and very infirm, and completely
wrapped up in his scientific studies. I only saw him occasionally,
and then my nonsense amused him. He pined after my step-mother;
and very shortly followed her to the grave. I had just attained my
majority when he died, and I came into a fine property, and found
myself at my own disposal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody cared for me, and I cared for nobody. I wished to take a
peep at the world, and determined to travel over as much of its
surface as I possibly could; and please myself as to the method I
employed to effect my object.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been in a great many foreign countries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> and seen a great
many strange people; and been an actor in many extraordinary
scenes; and I have come to the conclusion, that the world after
all is not such a terrible bad world to live in, and that the very
worst of its inhabitants are not entirely without some good.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she finished this sentence, the church clock proclaimed to the
whole town the hour of one. Miss Wilhelmina sprang from her chair,
exclaiming, &#8220;Holloa! that&#8217;s my dinner-hour. It will take me ten
minutes to get home, and the fish will be quite spoilt. Excuse me,
Mrs. Lyndsay, and come and take tea with me, like a good soul,
to-morrow evening. I never take tea later than six.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Wilhelmina vanished. Flora laughed over the interview until
her husband came home, and then they had a good laugh together.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>FLORA GOES TO TEA WITH MISS CARR.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> following evening, at the primitive hour of half-past five,
Flora took her work, and went across the green to take tea with
Miss Carr.</p>

<p>She found that eccentric lady seated by the window, looking out
for her, and Muff standing on her shoulder, catching flies off the
panes of glass. The evening was cold and raw, though the month was
August, and threatened rain. Such changes are common on the coast.
The dreary aspect of things without was relieved by a small but
very cheerful fire, which was burning away merrily in the grate. A
large easy chair, covered with snow-white dimity, was placed near
it, expressly for Flora&#8217;s accommodation, into which she was duly
inducted by Miss Carr, the moment she had relieved herself of her
bonnet and shawl. Everything looked so comfortable and cosy, in
the neat lodging-house, and the tame mad woman received Mrs.
Lyndsay with such hospitable warmth of manner, that the former
regretted that her husband was not allowed to share her visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are late,&#8221; said Wilhelmina, drawing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> small sofa up to the
fire, and placing it opposite to Flora&#8217;s easy chair, so that a
pretty work-table stood conveniently between them; &#8220;I told you to
come early, and I have been waiting for you this hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry for that. I thought I had come unfashionably early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fashion! What have you or I to do with anything so absurd as
fashion? You are too poor to attend to the whims and caprices
which sway the mind of the multitude, from which I presume emanate
the fashions of the world; and I am too independent to be swayed
by any will but my own. We will therefore set the fashion for
ourselves. This is liberty hall while I am mistress of it. I do as
I please; I give you full permission to do the same. But what kept
you so late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand little domestic duties, too numerous and too trifling
to dwell upon,&#8221; said Flora, drawing her work from her bag; &#8220;since
you give me the privilege of doing as I please, I will resume my
work, while I listen to your lively conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do no such thing,&#8221; returned Wilhelmina, twitching a
frill which Flora had commenced hemming, from her hand, &#8220;I will
have no stitching and sewing here, but as much conversation as you
please.&#8221; Then ringing the bell, she handed over the frill to Mrs.
Turner, &#8220;Give that to your daughter, Mrs. T., to hem for me, and
tell her to do it in her very best style.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&#8221;&#8220;Why, la, ma&#8217;am, &#8217;tis a very small affair,&#8221; said Mrs. Turner, with
a meaning smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nightcap frill for Muff,&#8221; said Miss Carr. &#8220;The cold weather is
coming. I mean Muff to wear caps in the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a droll lady,&#8221; said Mrs. Turner retreating; &#8220;it&#8217;s a pity
you had not something better to make an idol of, than a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Miss Carr was speaking to Mrs. Turner, Flora glanced round
the room, and was not a little surprised to find a pianoforte
making part of the furniture, an open drawing-box, of a very
expensive kind, with card-board and other drawing materials,
occupied a side-table. These were articles of refinement she had
not expected from a man-like woman of Miss Carr&#8217;s character.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you fond of drawing?&#8221; she asked, when they were once more
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Passionately, my dear: I am a self-taught genius. Other people
drew, and I was determined that I would draw too. What should
hinder me? I have eyes to see, and hands to copy what pleases me;
and the school from which I derive instruction is the best in the
world, and furnishes the most perfect models&#8212;that of Nature. I
never bent my mind to anything that I wished to accomplish, and
failed. But you shall judge for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Wilhelmina sprang from her seat, and bouncing into a closet,
soon returned with a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> portfolio, which she placed on the
table before Flora. &#8220;There are my treasures; you can examine them
at your leisure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora did not expect anything delicate or beautiful, but she was
perfectly astonished, not at the skill and taste displayed in
these drawings, but at the extraordinary want of it&#8212;nothing could
be worse, or indeed so eccentrically bad. The first specimen of
Miss Carr&#8217;s talents as an artist which she drew from the splendid
velvet-covered portfolio puzzled her not a little. What the
picture was meant for, Flora, for the life of her, could not tell,
until glancing down to the bottom of the sheet, she read with
great difficulty the following explanation, written in a vile
hand:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Portrait of the Incomparable Muff, taken while picking her bone
at breakfast.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a good thing she had discovered a key to the hieroglyphic,
for Miss Carr&#8217;s keen eyes were fixed intently upon her, as if they
were reading her inmost soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not beautiful?&#8221; she cried, anticipating Flora&#8217;s admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Muff is a very pretty animal,&#8221; said Flora evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Muff pretty!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Carr indignantly, &#8220;who ever thought
of insulting Muff by calling her <em>pretty</em>! She is exquisite&#8212;the
perfection of her species. I have, in that spirited picture, hit
her off to the life. Look at the action of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> that tail&#8212;the
life-like grasp of those paws. You might almost fancy you heard
her growl over the delicious broiled mutton-bone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora thought the picture would have suited the <em>Ornithorhyncus
paradoxus</em> quite as well as the incomparable Muff. The drawing was
too bad to praise; she could not flatter, and she abhorred
quizzing.</p>

<p>Miss Carr waited for her answer. Flora was dumb-foundered;
fortunately the offended vanity of the artist soon relieved her
from the painful and embarrassing silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I perceive that you are no judge of good paintings, Mrs. Lyndsay,
or you must see some merit in the one before you. I showed that
sketch to an Italian artist of celebrity when I was at Rome; he
said, &#8216;That it was worthy of the original,&#8217; which I considered no
mean praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless, he was right,&#8221; said Flora. &#8220;His judgment must be more
correct than mine. Muff is so unlike the generality of dogs, that
it is difficult to recognise her as such.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a fairy!&#8221; cried Wilhelmina, forgetting her anger, and
hugging Muff to her breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Brownie,&#8221; suggested Flora, delighted to find the conversation
taking a turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brownies belong to an inferior order of immortals,&#8221; quoth
Wilhelmina, still caressing her dog. &#8220;My Muff is among the
aristocrats of her species. But you have not seen the rest of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sketches. You will find a great many original pieces in the
portfolio.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora wished them all behind the fire, and turning with a rueful
seriousness to the sacred repository of <em>genius</em>, she drew forth
several daubs that were meant for landscapes, the contemplation of
which would have provoked the most indifferent person to mirth;
but it was no laughing matter to examine them while a being so odd
as Miss Carr was regarding you with a fixed gaze, hungry for
applause and admiration.</p>

<p>Flora thought she had discovered the maddest point in Miss Carr&#8217;s
character. At length she stumbled upon a portrait. The figure was
meant for that of a boy, but the head was as big as the head of a
man, and covered with a forest of red curling hair, and he held in
his hand a bunch of blue flowers as big as himself. &#8220;What an odd
looking creature!&#8221; burst involuntarily from her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my beautiful Adolphe!&#8221; cried Wilhelmina. &#8220;He was odd like
myself&#8212;he stood alone in the world in my estimation. I must tell
you the history of that child while you have his charming face
before you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora quietly slipped the portrait back into the portfolio. Her
inclination to laugh became almost irrepressible. Miss Wilhelmina
laid her right foot over her left knee, and, patting it almost as
complacently as she would have done the silky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> brown back of her
pet dog, gave Mrs Lyndsay the following passage from her
history:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;That boy, with the education I meant to bestow upon him, would
have become a great man&#8212;a second William Tell, or Andrew
Hoffer&#8212;and I should have been the foster-mother of a man of
genius. But it was not to be&#8212;there is a fate in these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he die?&#8221; asked Flora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Die! that would have been nothing out of the common way;
everybody must die, some time or other. Oh, no, he may be living
yet for what I know&#8212;it was far worse than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora became interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;First&#8212;I like to begin at the beginning&#8212;I must tell you how I
came by Adolphe. I passed the summer of &#8217;28 in a small village
among the Alps. Every fine day I rambled among the
mountains,&#8212;sometimes with a guide, sometimes alone. About half a
mile from the village I daily encountered, upon the rocky road, a
red-headed little boy of eight years of age, who never failed to
present me with a bunch of the blue flowers which grow just below
the regions of ice and snow. He presented his offering in such a
pretty, simple manner, that I never accepted his flowers without
giving him a kiss and a few small coins. We soon became great
friends, and he often accompanied me on my exploring expeditions.
Whether it was his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> red head&#8212;God bless the mark! or a likeness I
fancied I saw between him and me, I cannot tell; but at last I
grew so fond of the child that I determined to adopt him as my
own. His father was one of the mountain guides, and resided in a
small cabin among the hills. I followed Adolphe to his romantic
home, and disclosed my wishes to his parents. They were very poor
people, with a very large family, Adolphe being number twelve of
the domestic group.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a long time they resisted all my entreaties to induce them to
part with the child. The woman, like the mother of the Gracchi,
thought fit to look upon her children as her jewels,&#8212;Adolphe, in
particular, she considered the gem in the maternal crown. Her
opposition only increased my desire to gain possession of the boy;
indeed, I was so set upon having him that, had she remained
obstinate, I determined to carry him off without asking her leave
a second time. My gold, and the earnest request of the child
himself, at last overcame her scruples; and after binding me by a
solemn promise to let them see him at least once a-year, she gave
him into my charge with many tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having accomplished this business, greatly to my own
satisfaction, I set off with Adolphe, on a tour on foot through
Germany. He was not only a great comfort to me, but useful withal.
He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> was sturdy and strong, a real son of the hills, and he carried
my small valise, and enlivened the length of the road with his
agreeable prattle.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we put up for the night, the people always took him for my
son; a fact I thought it useless to dispute in a foreign country.
It would have had a more significant meaning in England. A
red-headed, single lady could not have travelled alone, with a
red-headed child, without disagreeable insinuations. Abroad I
always passed myself off as a widow, and Adolphe of course was my
orphan son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matters went off very pleasantly, until we arrived at Vienna, and
I hired a neat lodging in a quiet part of the city, where I
determined to spend the winter. The next morning I went out,
accompanied by Adolphe, to examine the lions of the place. By
accident we got entangled in a crowd, which had collected in one
of the principal thoroughfares, to witness a fire. While striving
to stem my way through the heaving mass of human forms that hedged
us in on every side, I suddenly missed my child. To find him among
such a multitude, was, indeed, to look for a needle in a waggon of
hay; yet I commenced the search in utter desperation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ran hither and thither, wherever I could find an opening,
frantically calling upon Adolphe. I asked every person whom I
met&#8212;&#8216;If they had seen my boy?&#8217; Some pitied&#8212;some laughed; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the greater number bade me stand out of their way. I was mad with
fear and excitement, and returned to my lodgings late in the
evening, starving with hunger, and worn out with fatigue of mind
and body. I hoped that the child might have found his way home,
and was waiting me there. Alas! Adolphe had not been seen, and I
went to bed too much vexed to eat my supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Early the next morning I resumed my search. I hired the public
cryer to proclaim my loss; I borrowed a large bell from my
landlady, and went through all the streets crying him myself,
hoping that he would recognise my voice. Alas! alas! I never saw
my child again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never?&#8221; said Flora. &#8220;Was he irrevocably lost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost, lost, lost!&#8221; said Wilhelmina, shaking her head. &#8220;This comes
of adopting other people&#8217;s brats. Had he been a worthless, spoilt
imp of my own, I should have been more successful. I stayed in
Vienna all the winter. I advertised him in the papers. I had
placards, offering a large reward for his discovery, pasted on the
walls of the principal streets; but I failed in recovering my poor
Adolphe. To console myself for his loss, I painted that portrait
of him from memory. &#8217;Tis an admirable likeness. No one who had
ever seen the original, could mistake it for another. It was just
a week after I lost my child, that the mistress of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> the house, in
compassion for my distress, presented me with my incomparable
Muff. Fortune owed me a good turn, for the ill-natured trick she
had played me. It would not have been difficult for me to have
found another red-headed boy, as amiable as Adolphe; but such a
prize as Muff is only to be met with once in a life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the parents of the poor child,&#8212;how did they bear his loss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth, my dear, I never knew. I never wish to
know; for, without Adolphe, I never mean to venture into their
neighbourhood again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us hope,&#8221; said Flora, &#8220;that the child found his way back to
his native mountains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurra!&#8221; cried Miss Wilhelmina, starting from her seat, and giving
Flora such a hearty embrace that she nearly choked her. &#8220;I never
thought of that possibility before. Yes&#8212;yes; he had money in his
little purse. I have no doubt that, on missing me, he returned by
the road we had travelled to his native place. That demon won&#8217;t
haunt my dreams again. But here comes the coffee, and Miss
Turner&#8217;s delicious cakes and home-made bread and butter. I hope
you are fond of coffee, my dear? I detest tea;&#8212;it is a sort of
nervous, maudlin, sick-chamber trash, only fit for old maids and
milk-and-water matrons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer coffee,&#8221; said Flora. &#8220;I have quite an Asiatic taste in
that respect.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk of Asiatic coffee,&#8221; said Wilhelmina: &#8220;wait till you
have tasted it. The nauseous stuff! I have drank enough of it at
Constantinople, but never could get it down without a grimace. I
have it made in the French style.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coffee and cakes were served on a small silver tray, which was
placed on the table between them. The coffee was fragrant and
exhilarating; the bread and butter and cakes richly deserved the
praise Miss Wilhelmina had bestowed upon them. Flora had dined
early, and did justice to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to see a person enjoy their meals,&#8221; said Miss Carr. &#8220;I
hate affectation in eating, as much as I hate affectation in
speech. Some mince with their food as if they were ashamed of
putting a morsel into their mouths before people. They ask for the
least piece of this, and for an imaginary crumb of that; and make
their entertainers uncomfortable by their ridiculous
fastidiousness; while, if we could see these very delicate
masticators in their own homes, perhaps we should find them
grumbling for Benjamin&#8217;s share of the daily meal. For my own part,
I always eat in public as if no eye was upon me, and do it in a
hearty, natural way. You may be sure, when you see persons,
whether male or female, give themselves great airs at table, that
they have never been used to good society at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora thought there was a great deal of truth in some of
Wilhelmina&#8217;s remarks. But she felt that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> it would be dangerous to
take the doings of such an odd mortal for precedents in any case;
and she was justified in her opinion by Miss Carr, the moment the
table was cleared, calling for hot water, brandy, and wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you smoke?&#8221; she cried, producing a box of cigars from the
closet, and a long Turkish pipe. Then, drawing down the
window-curtains, she tucked her legs under her upon the sofa, and
commenced filling, from a beautiful inlaid silver box, her hooker,
with its finely-ornamented bowl and amber mouthpiece.</p>

<p>Flora looked her astonishment, as she said,&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Carr, do you <em>really</em> smoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know what is good?&#8221; said Wilhelmina. &#8220;Did you never see a
woman smoke before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Irish barrow-women in London; and I thought it odd, even for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were wise women, my dear, and knew how to appreciate the
merits of the weed. The Irish are a clever people&#8212;a very clever
people. You remember, that I am Irish by the mother&#8217;s side, and
have retained one of the national tastes. But it was not in
Ireland, nor in the streets of London, sitting upon a
fruit-woman&#8217;s barrow, that I learned the pleasures of smoking. It
was in the East, with all its pretended romance, and real humbug,
that I acquired what you consider an unfeminine accomplishment. I
saw fat, turbaned men sitting cross-legged in every bazaar,
dozing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> over their huge pipes, in a sort of dreamy helplessness;
and I determined to fathom the mystery of their enjoyment, and
find out the grand secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first few whiffs I took made me very sick and stupid.
&#8216;Courage,&#8217; said I, not in the least disheartened&#8212;</p>

<div class="block">

</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">And I did try, for I was determined not to be beaten by
these long-bearded, long-petticoated men; and the next trial was
crowned with complete success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mrs. Lyndsay, is it not a shame that these selfish men
should be tamely allowed by us foolish women to monopolise all the
good things of life, and make that criminal in a female which they
cannot deny themselves? You don&#8217;t know how much you lose, by being
frightened by their blustering into passive obedience, and
persuaded that what is good for a man is quite out of keeping with
a woman. Do, just by way of illustration to my argument, try one
of those fragrant cigars. They are of the best quality&#8212;real
<a name="havana" id="havana"></a><ins title="Havanna in original">Havana</ins>&#8212;&#8217;pon honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must excuse me,&#8221; said Flora, laughing&#8212;as Miss Wilhelmina&#8217;s
head dimly loomed through clouds of smoke&#8212;&#8220;I have no wish to
acquire such a taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a little fool,&#8221; puffed forth Wilhelmina.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> &#8220;But I hope to
make something out of you yet. Take a glass of wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never drink anything but water, excepting at breakfast and
tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Water! Fiddle-faddle. A tumbler of hot punch will do you no harm.
I am going to mix some in the most scientific manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only think what Lyndsay would say,&#8221; cried Flora, &#8220;if he should
come in, and find me smoking a cigar, and drinking brandy punch?
He would never forgive me&#8212;I could never forgive myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All stuff and nonsense; I am certain he would neither refuse one
of these cigars, nor a tumbler of this excellent punch. Does he
never smoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; a cigar, sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And takes a glass of toddy&#8212;or he&#8217;s no Scot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Occasionally, with a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A male friend, <em>of course</em>. He takes snuff, for I have seen him
do it; and this, between ourselves, is a far dirtier habit than
smoking. I hate snuff; it always reminds me of a lecture I once
heard upon that subject in America. The lecturer was a methodist;
and he spoke very vehemently against the use of tobacco in any
shape; but snuff-taking seemed to rouse him up, and inflame his
indignation to a pitch of enthusiasm. &#8216;If the Almighty,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;had intended a man&#8217;s nose for a dust-hole, he would have turned
up the nostrils the other way.&#8217; These were his very words; and to
me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> they were so convincing, that I discarded from that moment all
idea of becoming a snuff-taker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wilhelmina emptied her tumbler of brandy and water, which she as
quickly replenished. These strong potations began to take
effect&#8212;her eyes danced in her head, and she became so strangely
excited, that Flora wished devoutly that she was safe at home.
Presently her odd companion laid aside her pipe, pushed from
before her the now empty tumbler, and, rising abruptly,
exclaimed&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora thought that she might have come to that conclusion half an
hour before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not intoxicated,&#8221; she said: &#8220;I only drink enough to raise my
spirits, and drive away the blue devils. And now for a little
music.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down to the piano.</p>

<p>&#8220;I play entirely from ear, Mrs. Lyndsay; I leave you to judge if I
have not an exquisite taste. Here is a march I composed this
morning for Captain Lyndsay&#8217;s black regiment&#8212;Hottentot of course.
You say he plays well himself. He cannot fail to admire it. I will
write it out for him to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of all Miss Carr&#8217;s strange whims, the idea she entertained of her
being a great musician, was the most absurd. She rattled over the
keys at a tremendous rate, striking them with such force that she
made the instrument shake. It was a mad revel&#8212;a hurricane of
sound, yet, not without a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> degree of eccentric talent. In
the midst of a tremendous passage there came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my husband,&#8221; said Flora, rising, glad to get away.</p>

<p>It was only the maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are no prophet,&#8221; said Miss Carr, rattling on; &#8220;you must stay
till I give you <em>Napoleon&#8217;s Passage of the Alps</em>. I wrote it on
the spot. It is a grand thing. I mean to publish it one of these
<a name="quote2" id="quote2"></a><ins title="original had &#8217;">days.&#8221;</ins></p>

<p>Flora said, &#8220;that she should be happy to hear it some other time.
It was late. She was anxious to get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be off with you then,&#8221; said Wilhelmina, laughing, &#8220;and don&#8217;t tell
me any white lies, or try and convince your good man, that I have
been endeavouring to corrupt your morals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyndsay was amused, but not much pleased, with the account his
wife gave him of her visit to Miss Carr.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must drop that woman&#8217;s acquaintance, if possible,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Whether insane, or only eccentric, any particular intimacy with
her must be attended with unpleasant consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was willing enough to follow his advice; but to get rid of
Miss Carr was sooner said than done. Flora did not go to that
lady&#8217;s house, but Wilhelmina chose to come to her; though she gave
her neither pipes to smoke, nor brandy to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> drink, her odd guest
never failed to step in once or twice a week.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an ungrateful creature, Flora Lyndsay,&#8221; said Wilhelmina,
one day to her&#8212;&#8220;very ungrateful. You know I am fond of you; but
you are such a mental coward, that you are ashamed of my
acquaintance, because the world finds fault with me, for not
living in accordance with its lying customs. You are afraid lest
people should sneer at you for tolerating my eccentricities, as
they please to term a person leading a true life&#8212;or say, that
Mrs. Lyndsay smokes, and drinks, and swears, because Miss Carr
does; and your sense of propriety is shocked at such an idea. I do
drink and smoke; but like Poll, in the sailor&#8217;s song, &#8216;<em>I seldom
swear.</em>&#8217; It gives me no pleasure; and I never do anything
gratuitously bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora could not deny, that these were among the objections she had
to an intimacy with Miss Carr; but she wisely held her tongue upon
the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; said Wilhelmina, after waiting a reasonable time for
an answer, and getting <a name="comma" id="comma"></a><ins title="comma in original">none.</ins> &#8220;Your silence is very conclusive
evidence of the accusation I have brought against you. I give you
credit for being honest, at least. You are no sneak, though I am
rich, and you are poor. I verily believe, that you are prouder of
your poverty, than I am of my wealth. I know many persons who hate
me, and would yet fawn to me before my face, while they abused me
like pickpockets behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> my back. You are not one of them, and I
love you for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora had a kindness for Wilhelmina. She believed her to be mad,
and not accountable for her actions, and she tried to persuade her
to give over her rambling propensities, and accept the protection
of her brother&#8217;s roof. This advice greatly displeased Miss Carr.
Flora might as well have striven to confine a hurricane within the
bounds of a cambric pocket-handkerchief, as to lay the least
embargo upon that lady&#8217;s freedom of speech or action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind your own business! Mrs. Lyndsay,&#8221; she said, angrily. &#8220;I
suffer no one to interfere with me, or my matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>For many months Wilhelmina never entered the house, though she
walked past the window every day, to give Flora a hint that she
was still in the land of the living.</p>

<p>In February Mrs. Lyndsay&#8217;s little girl was born; and for a very
long time she was too ill to stir abroad. Miss Carr sent Mrs.
Turner every day to inquire after her health; and testified her
regard in a more substantial form, by sending her two dozen of old
Madeira wine, which she said would strengthen and do her good.
Flora was very grateful for these little attentions, and felt
ashamed of the repugnance she had shown for Wilhelmina&#8217;s society.
But they never met again, until Miss Carr came to bid her
farewell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&#8220;You are going to Canada,&#8221; she said, shaking Flora heartily by the
hand. &#8220;You are wise. In that wild country you will enjoy the
glorious privilege of living as you please. I would go too, but I
am afraid the cold winters would not agree with Muff, and her
comfort has to be considered as well as my own. I spent a winter
in New York; and I liked the Americans first-rate. But as to pure
democracy, my dear, that&#8217;s all a humbug. No well-educated, wealthy
persons, ever consider themselves upon an equality with their
servants. But they are pleasant, kind, intelligent people to live
with, if you have plenty of money, and dress well. I know nothing
of Canada; it was too insignificant to awaken either interest or
curiosity. I shall regard it with more complacency for your sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora took the opportunity of thanking Miss Carr for her kindness
during her illness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a serious matter you make of a trifle!&#8221; said Wilhelmina,
laughing. &#8220;Don&#8217;t thank me. It was neither out of love nor charity
I sent it, but just to make you confess that wine was a good thing
after all, and much better to take than the doctor&#8217;s stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor had recommended wine, but we could not afford it. I
never told Lyndsay a word about it, for fear he should lay out the
money we wanted so much for our voyage, in such an expensive
remedy. I am certain that it did me a great deal of good.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>&#8220;Doubtless,&#8221; said Wilhelmina. &#8220;I am glad to have rendered you a
service, however trifling. You are a clear, prudent creature, but
want spirit to live as you please. I leave this hum-drum place
to-morrow. Perhaps some of these days we may meet again; if not,
you may live to learn that you slighted the friendship of one of
the greatest geniuses that has arisen in this age.&#8221;</p>

it. Who or what she was remains a riddle to this day: we are

<small>OLD JARVIS AND HIS DOG NEPTUNE.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Ma&#8217;am</span>, old Jarvis is in the kitchen. He has brought some fish,
and wants to see you,&#8221; said Flora&#8217;s maid one morning, as her
mistress had just finished washing and dressing the baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor old man! I thought he was dead,&#8221; said Flora. &#8220;I have not
seen him for such a long time!&#8221; and, with baby in her arms, she
followed the girl into the kitchen.</p>

<p>David Jarvis was a fisherman, well known upon that coast,&#8212;an
active, energetic son of the sea, though somewhat time-worn and
weather-beaten. The person of the old man had been familiar to
Flora since she was a little child; and many a stolen trip had she
taken with her brothers in his cockleshell of a boat, which, tough
as its master, had stood the wear and tear of the winds and waves
for many years.</p>

<p>Since she came to reside at &#8212;&mdash;, she had often watched that
little boat dancing over the waves, carried onward by a stiff
breeze,&#8212;now hiding in the green valleys of the sea, now mounting
aloft, like a feather floating on the ridge of some toppling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
surge. The old man seemed to bear a charmed life; for at all
seasons, and in almost all weather, the little wiry seaman, with
his short pipe in his mouth, and his noble Newfoundland dog,
Neptune, in the bow of his boat, might be seen coasting along the
shore, following his adventurous calling.</p>

<p>That large, deep-chested, powerful dog, was the admiration of all
the children in the town. It was considered a privilege by the
young fry to pat Neptune&#8217;s buff head, and call him the &#8220;dear,
good, old dog!&#8221; and well did the fine animal deserve the title.</p>

<p>The good dog had, at different times, saved nine seamen from a
watery grave, as the collar he wore round his neck recording the
fact could testify.</p>

<p>Next to his two fine sons, Nep was the delight of the old man&#8217;s
heart. They were never seen apart. In storm or shine, Nep
accompanied his master in the boat; or, if fishing on the beach,
he sat up on his haunches, with a calm, sagacious air, watching
the accumulating pile of fish entrusted to his care. Sociable,
affable, and gentle, he submitted good-humouredly to the caresses
of all the youngsters who passed that way; but if any one dared to
lay a finger upon the fish, the lion-like nature of the animal was
roused into instant action. His mild eye became red and fiery, and
his deep voice bade defiance to the incautious intruder on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
master&#8217;s rights, to protect which Nep was ready to lay down his
valuable life.</p>

<p>Jarvis and his dog enjoyed a great degree of popularity in an
humble way; and were decidedly among the lions of the place.
Gentlemen had offered large sums for the buff Newfoundland dog,
which Jarvis had rejected without a second thought; declaring,
that he would as soon sell a child for money, as his faithful Nep.</p>

<p>During the past year the old seaman had been severely tried.
Misfortune had followed upon misfortune; until the hardy veteran
looked like the spectre of his former self. His only daughter, a
pretty girl of eighteen, was engaged to marry the ostler at the
Crown Inn, a fine-looking young man, who had lately come from
London. He saw Nancy Jarvis, became enamoured of the fisherman&#8217;s
daughter, told his tale of love, and was accepted. The old man was
rather averse to the match; for, in his eyes, no man was worthy of
his Nancy, who was not a genuine son of the sea. Robert Green at
last succeeded in overcoming his nautical prejudices; and a day
was fixed for the wedding. Nancy&#8217;s rosy, artless face was all
smiles and sunshine, as night after night she sauntered past
Flora&#8217;s windows, leaning upon the arm of her betrothed. Only two
days previous to the one appointed for the wedding, the father
learned from old captain P&#8212;&mdash;, whose vessel had just returned
from London, that Robert Green had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> wife and two children in the
great city; that the poor young woman, hearing that his vessel was
from the Port of &#8212;&mdash;, had come on board, to make some inquiries
respecting her faithless husband; and that she and her little ones
were now on their way to join him.</p>

<p>This distressing intelligence was rashly communicated without any
previous warning, to Nancy Jarvis. The unfortunate girl, seized
with a sudden frenzy, rushed to the pier and flung herself into
the sea, when the tide was running out; and her distracted parents
never succeeded in recovering the body of the poor maniac. The
worthless libertine, on whose account this desperate act was
committed, decamped in the night; and so escaped the vengeance of
the old fisherman and his sons.</p>

<p>Davy Jarvis, the old seaman&#8217;s youngest son, a fine lad of sixteen,
was drowned in the month of July, only a few weeks after the
tragical death of his sister. Flora and Lyndsay had been
eye-witnesses of this fresh calamity. Every fine afternoon the
young Davy was in the habit of going off with another boy, of his
own age, in his father&#8217;s boat. When they had rowed a couple of
miles from the shore, they lay to, stripped, and went into the
water to swim, diving and sporting among the waves, like two
sea-gulls taking their pastime in the summer ocean.</p>

<p>Lyndsay had often watched them, and admired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> the dexterity with
which the younger Jarvis would tumble himself from the water into
the boat, which was left rocking upon the billows, and steady it
for his comrade to get in. They would then resume their garments,
and row to the beach.</p>

<p>One afternoon they went off as usual. The day was bright and
cloudless, with a stiff breeze. Lyndsay was reading aloud to
Flora, as she sat at work at the open window which commanded a
view of the whole bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Davy Jarvis and his comrade, putting off their boat, for
a swim. They must mind what they are about,&#8221; said Lyndsay; &#8220;the
wind is rather too blustering for their water frolic to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put down his book, and continued to watch the lads with some
interest. The boys reached their accustomed track among the waves;
and, leaving their boat as usual, seemed to enjoy their sport with
more zest than ever. Whilst in the water, the breeze freshened,
and it was with great difficulty, and not without hard swimming,
that the lads regained their boat, which driven before the wind,
seemed determined to reach the shore without them. They succeeded
at last, dressed themselves, and stood in for the land. A long
line of heavy surf was beating violently against the beach, and by
some <a name="mismanagement" id="mismanagement"></a><ins title="mismagement in original">mismanagement</ins>, the boat got capsized among the breakers. One
lad was thrown on shore, but Davy Jarvis got entangled in the
surf, which beat continually over him, and rendered all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> the
efforts of himself and his comrade fruitless; and the brave boy
was drowned before the sailors who hurried to his assistance could
rescue him from his perilous situation.</p>

<p>Flora had watched the scene with a degree of excitement so
intense, that it almost deprived her of breath. She could not
believe that the lad could perish within the reach of help, and so
near the shore. The shrieks of the mother, and the mute despair of
the old fisherman, who had been summoned to the spot, too clearly
corroborated the report of Lyndsay, that the lad was indeed dead.</p>

<p>After this fresh calamity old Jarvis appeared an altered man. His
sinewy frame became bent and attenuated, his step fell feebler,
his hair was bleached to snowy whiteness, and his homely, tanned
features assumed an expression of stern and patient endurance. It
was evident to Flora that his heart was breaking for the loss of
his children.</p>

<p>Neptune seemed to understand it all&#8212;to comprehend in the fullest
sense his master&#8217;s loss and his present sufferings. He would walk
slowly by the fisherman&#8217;s side, and whenever he paused in his
unsteady aimless ramble along the beach, Nep would thrust his nose
into his hard brown hand, or, rearing on his hind legs, embrace
him with his shaggy fore-paws, fawning and whining to attract his
notice, and divert him from his melancholy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Day after day, during the long bright summer of 1831, Flora had
watched the old man come to the spot on the beach where the dead
body of his son first touched the shore, and stand there for
hours, looking out over the broad sea, his eyes shaded from the
rays of the sun by his bony red hand, as if he expected the return
of the lost one. During these fits of abstraction Nep would
stretch himself along the beach at the fisherman&#8217;s feet, his head
sunk between his fore-paws, as motionless as the statue of a dog
cut out of stone. The moment the old man dropped the raised hand
from his face, Nep would leap to his feet, look up wistfully into
his master&#8217;s eyes, and follow him home.</p>

<p>This touching scene had drawn tears from Flora more than once, and
she loved the good dog for his devoted attachment to the
grief-stricken desolate old man. When, however, the fishing season
returned, Jarvis roused himself from the indulgence of hopeless
grief. The little cockle-shell of a boat was once more launched
upon the blue sea, and Jarvis might daily be seen spreading its
tiny white sheet to the breeze, while the noble buff Newfoundland
dog resumed his place in the bow.</p>

<p>Jarvis came regularly every day to the house to offer fish for
sale&#8212;cod, whitings, herrings, whatever fish chance had given to
his net. Flora was glad to observe something like cheerfulness
once more illumine the old sailor&#8217;s face. She always greeted him
with kind words, and inquired affectionately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> after his welfare;
and without alluding to his heavy family afflictions, made him
sensible that she deeply sympathised in his grief.</p>

<p>Things went on smoothly, until one terrible night in October,
Jarvis and his only remaining son, a strong powerful man of
thirty, had been off with several experienced seamen in the
pilot-boat, to put a pilot on board a large vessel which was
toiling her way through the storm to London. Coming back, the wind
rose to a gale, and the sailors, in trying to enter the harbour,
ran the boat against one of the piers with such violence, that it
upset, and the whole party were thrown into the water.</p>

<p>Old Jarvis was an admirable swimmer, and soon gained the beach, as
did most of the others, two of their number being rescued from
death by the exertions of the brave dog. One alone was
missing&#8212;Harry Jarvis was the lost man.</p>

<p>From that hour Flora had never seen the old Jarvis or his dog. The
boat lay high and dry upon the beach, and his net was still
suspended between the poles where it had been left to dry, and she
concluded that Jarvis had not survived this last terrible blow. It
was a joyful surprise, therefore, to hear, that he was not only
alive, but pursuing his old calling.</p>

<p>She found the fisherman leaning against the open kitchen-door, a
basket of fish at his feet, and his clear grey eyes fixed vacantly
upon the silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> waves, which flashing and murmuring in the
sunlight, came racing to the beach below. The old sailors&#8217;
wrinkled face, once so ruddy and bronzed, was as white as his
hair; his cheeks had fallen in, and deep hollows had gathered
about his temples; it was painful to observe the great alteration
in his appearance since they last met. The old man started from
his abstraction, as Flora&#8217;s foot sounded on the floor, and he
tried to smile. It was a vain attempt, his shrunken features
instantly contracted into their former melancholy expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;My good old friend&#8221; said Flora, &#8220;I am glad to see you; I was
afraid you had been ill. What fish have you got for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eels, Madam; I caught them in the river. They ar&#8217;n&#8217;t for sale,
but just a little present. I he&#8217;erd you wor goin&#8217; to cross the
salt seas to Canady, an&#8217; I had a mind to see you agin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will accept them with pleasure, Davy, and I am very much
obliged to you for your kindness. I am very fond of eels,&#8212;we get
them so seldom, they are quite a treat. I have not seen you out in
the boat lately, Jarvis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll never see me out in her agin,&#8221; said the fisherman.
&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking my fishing days are &#8217;most over; boat, tackle and
measter are all worn out together. I&#8217;ve parted with the boat;
how&#8217;somever. An&#8217; as to the sea, I allers look&#8217;d upon its broad
face with pleasure, but t&#8217;has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> a cruel enemy to me and mine;
my path, I&#8217;m thinking, will be over it no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora saw the tear glistening in the old man&#8217;s eye, and she tried
to divert his attention by asking him what he had done with his
dog&#8212;&#8220;with dear, old &#8216;Nep?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shot him.&#8221; The seaman&#8217;s thin lips quivered, and his whole frame
trembled. &#8220;Ay, I shot my good dog&#8212;my brave, faithful dog,&#8212;the
best, the truest friend man ever had; an&#8217; I&#8217;ve niver know&#8217;d a
happy hour since.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bright drops were now raining down the old man&#8217;s cheeks.</p>

<p>Flora reached him a chair, and begged him to sit down. The
fisherman mechanically obeyed, with his chin sunk between his
hands, and his elbows resting on his knees. For some minutes both
were silent, until the old man said, in a thick, husky voice&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I shot &#8216;Nep&#8217;&#8212;shot him with my own hand. It wor cruel and
wicked of me to do the like, but I wor mad&#8212;stark staring mad, and
who&#8217;s to blame? You see, my lady, he wor with us that terrible
Saturday night, when we went off to put the pilot on board the
brig <em>Sally</em>, from Shields. Comin&#8217; back it wor pitch dark, an&#8217; the
sea runnin&#8217; mountains high, Sam Masters ran the boat plump upon
the pier, an&#8217; we wor upset on the bar. Nep saved Sam Masters and
Ben Hardy, but he let my Harry drown. I never rebelled agin&#8217; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
providence of God till then; but I trust He&#8217;ll forgive what the
old man said in his mortal distress. Instead of thanking Him, when
I sor that so many wor safe, an&#8217; encouragin&#8217; Nep for having saved
two on &#8217;em, I cursed the dog for an ungrateful brute for saving
strangers, an&#8217; letting my Harry be lost. I dashed him off whenever
he&#8217;d come whining around, to lick my hands an&#8217; make friends, an&#8217;
when I got home I took down the old gun&#8212;poor Harry&#8217;s gun&#8212;and
called Nep out upon the cliff an&#8217; shot him dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repented the moment I sor him drop. It wor too late then. I
thought that both Davy and Harry would have blamed me for taking
the poor brute&#8217;s life&#8212;for they wor mortal fond of &#8217;un. The next
morning I wor up by daybreak, and down to the piers in the little
boat to see if I might chance to light upon the dead body.</p>

<p>&#8220;The storm was over, an&#8217; in rowing &#8217;atwixt the piers, I sor summut
that looked like the thing I sought, hanging, as it wor, to the
planking of the pier. I steered for the place, an&#8217;, God o&#8217; heaven!
it wor the body of my son! He wor just two feet below the water,
hanging with his head downwards. The force of the waves had driven
him upon an iron stauncheon, which extended some distance from the
pier, the woodwork to which it belonged had been wrenched away in
the storm. It had passed right through Harry&#8217;s body, and held him
fast. And the dog&#8212;the poor dog&#8212;had tried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> get him off; he had
dragged at his jacket and shirt-collar, till they wor all shred to
bits, and had only given over when he found it of no use, an&#8217; then
did what he could to save the rest! An&#8217; I killed him&#8212;I, that
should have fed and cherished him to his dying day&#8212;I can never
forgive myself for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not distress yourself, Jarvis, in this way. No one will blame
you for what you did in such a distracted state of mind,&#8221; said
Flora, though she was grieved to the heart for the death of the
noble dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right&#8212;you are just right; I was mad; and you must not
think hard of a poor broken-hearted old man. My sorrow is &#8217;most
greater than I can bear. It will not be for long; I feel I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
the way of all the earth, an&#8217; it matters little when we cast
anchor in that port, whether our voyage wor short or long&#8212;rough
or smooth, when the righteous Judge overhauls our vessel, an&#8217; lays
bare the secrets of all hearts. I trust He&#8217;ll have mercy on old
Davy Jarvis, and forgive him for the death of his brave dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fisherman took the eels from his basket, and grasping Flora&#8217;s
hand in his hard horny palm, said, &#8220;May the Lord grant you
prosperity! an&#8217; bless you an&#8217; your husband an&#8217; the little &#8217;un, an&#8217;
bring you safe to the far land to which you are journeying! May it
prove to you a haven of rest! God bless you! good bye!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>Flora looked after the drooping figure of the fisherman as he
slowly descended the cliff, and she thought how intense must have
been his agony in that dark hour of utter bereavement, which had
tempted him to sacrifice his dog on the mere supposition that he
had neglected to save the life of his son.</p>

<p>&#8220;God comfort you! poor Jarvis,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and guide you in peace
through the shadows of the dark valley that stretches its long
night before you. The grief which has brought your grey locks in
sorrow to the grave was enough to have broken a sterner heart.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>FLORA IN SEARCH OF A SERVANT HEARS A REAL GHOST STORY.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Lyndsay</span> had charged Flora, during his absence, to inquire for a
female servant, to accompany them to Canada, and take care of the
baby during the voyage. Flora was very reluctant to obey this
command, though she knew that it was entirely on her account that
the request was made. Her health was still very bad, and her kind
husband was anxious to spare her any additional fatigue and
trouble. She much doubted, however, whether another added to their
party would not rather increase than diminish her anxiety, and she
begged hard to be allowed to do without. To this proposition
Lyndsay would not listen for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing is impossible, Flora,&#8221; said he, very impetuously, &#8220;you
cannot do without; you are not able to nurse the child. I must
insist upon your hiring a woman immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora sighed. &#8220;There will be plenty of women in the steerage of
any emigrant vessel, who for the sake of a few dollars would
gladly render me all the assistance I require.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>&#8220;You must not trust to such contingencies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, husband dear, consider the great additional expense,&#8221; she
said, coaxingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8212;that is my affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to have my own way in this matter,&#8221; said Flora,
leaning her hand upon his shoulder, and trying to win him into
compliance by sundry little caresses. &#8220;I know, John, that I am in
the right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And those who love you, Flora, and wish to spare you fatigue and
discomfort, are in the wrong. Is it not so?&#8221;</p>

<p>This last speech silenced his wife, but did not convince her that
she was wrong. Flora, as my readers must long ago have discovered,
was no heroine of romance, but a veritable human creature, subject
to all the faults and weaknesses incidental to her sex. She wished
to have her own way, and was ready to cry that she could not get
it. Yet, had her advice been acted upon, she would have been
spared a great deal of sorrow and mortification, which greatly
embittered the first months of her sojourn in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Persons emigrating to Canada cannot be guilty of a greater blunder
than that of taking out servants with them, which is sure to end
in loss and disappointment; for they no sooner set foot upon the
North American shores, than they suddenly become possessed with an
<em>ultra republican</em> spirit. The chrysalis has burst its dingy
shell; they are no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> longer caterpillars, but gay butterflies,
prepared to bask in the sun-blaze of popular rights. Ask such a
domestic to blacken your shoes, clean a knife, or fetch a pail of
water from the well at the door, and ten to one she will turn upon
you as fierce as a lioness, and bid you do it yourself. If you are
so imprudent as to insist on being obeyed, she will tell you to
hire another in her place; she is sure of twenty situations as
good as yours, to-morrow.</p>

<p>She is right in her assertion. Her insolent rejection of your
commands would not stand at all in her way of procuring a new
place. And although cleaning a lady&#8217;s shoes, and bringing in a
pail of water, or an armful of wood, is by no means such
disgusting employment as scouring greasy pots and scrubbing the
floors, she has been told that the former is degrading work not
fit for a woman, and she is now in a free country, and will not
submit to degradation.</p>

<p>The mistress, who in England was termed the <em>dear lady</em>, now
degenerates into the <em>woman</em>, while persons in their own class,
and even beggars seeking for alms are addressed as Ma&#8217;am and Sir.
How particular they are in enforcing these titles from one
another; how persevering in depriving their employers of any term
of respect! One would imagine that they not only considered
themselves on an equality, but that ignorance and vulgarity made
them vastly superior. It is highly amusing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> to watch from a
distance these self-made ladies and gentlemen sporting their
borrowed plumes.</p>

<p>Some years after she had been settled in Canada, Flora picked up a
note which had been thrown out as waste paper, and which was
addressed to the father of a very dirty, dishonest girl, whom she
had dismissed from her service for sundry petty frauds, a few
weeks before. It was addressed to Edward Brady, Esqre., and ran as
follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Honoured Sir,</p>

<p>&#8220;The company of <em>self</em> and <em>lady</em>, is respectfully solicited at
a <em>contribution</em> ball, to be given next Thursday evening, at the
Three King&#8217;s Inn. Dancing to commence at eight o&#8217;clock
precisely.</p>

<table summary="Stewards">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">Stewards</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="top"><span class="bracket">{</span></td>
<td>Patrick Malone, Esq.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>John Carroll, Esq.&#8221;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>


<p class="noi">All the parties herein named were persons of the very
lowest class; and the titles thus pompously bestowed upon
themselves, rendered the whole affair exquisitely ridiculous. At a
<em>contribution</em> ball, each person brings a share of the
entertainment. Flora&#8217;s maid had stolen a large quantity of sugar
for her part of the feast, and was discovered in the act.</p>

<p>In compliance with Lyndsay&#8217;s request, Flora now set diligently to
work to inquire for a girl willing to emigrate with them to
Canada, in the capacity of nurse to her baby. She had scarcely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
made her wishes public, before the cottage was beset with matrons,
widows and maids, both old and young, all anxious to take a trip
across the water, and try their fortunes in Canada.</p>

<p>The first person who presented herself as a candidate for
emigration, was a coarse, fat, she-clown, with huge red fists and
cheeks, &#8220;as broad and as red as a pulpit cushion.&#8221; On being shown
into Flora&#8217;s little parlour, she stood staring at her with her
arms stuck in her sides, and her wide mouth distended from ear to
ear, with a grin so truly uncouth and comic, that Mrs. Lyndsay
could scarcely restrain her laughter; with a downward jerk of her
broad shapeless person, meant for a curtsy, she burst out in a
rude vulgar voice,</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;eard, Marm, yah wanted a gurl to go with yah to Cannadah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. Who sent you up to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whao sent oie up? Oie sent up moisel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moi neame? Is&#8217;t moi neame yah wants to knowah? Wall, moi neame is
Sare Ann Pack; feather warks at Measter Turners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever worked out, or been used to take care of children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why yees, oie &#8217;spect oie ha&#8217;. Moother has ten on &#8217;em. Oie be the
oldest on&#8217;em. Oi&#8217;ve had nursing enoof, an&#8217; wants to get quit on
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, Sarah, you will not suit me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>&#8220;How dew yah noa, Marm, till yah tries?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very slatternly, and I wanted a clean, tidy, active girl
to nurse my baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure moi cloes is clane enoof, and good enoof, for to live
amongst the sadvidges?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be put to no such trial,&#8221; said Flora laughing, in spite of
herself, &#8220;without you reckon me and my husband sadvadges. Can you
wash and iron?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Noa. But &#8217;spose oie cud larn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What work can you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Spect anything yah sets oie to. Oie can make doomplings, milk
cows, and keep the pot a bilin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what wages do you expect for such services?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it to goor to Cannadah? Oh, oie &#8217;spects tree punds o&#8217; month
for the loike o&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must stay at home then, my good girl, and boil the
dumplings,&#8221; said Flora. &#8220;Indeed, I cannot imagine what induced you
to come up here to offer me your services. You literally can do
nothing, for which you expect exorbitant wages. Why do you wish to
leave your friends, to go out with strangers to Canada?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s moi consarn,&#8221; said the girl, with one of her gigantic
expansions of mouth. &#8220;Oie he&#8217;eard &#8217;twas a mortal good place for
maids getting married. Husbands are scearce here, so oise thought,
oise might as well try moi chance as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> rest o&#8217;un. Won&#8217;t yah
take oie?&#8221; Flora shook her head.</p>

<p>The girl twirled the strings of her checked apron, &#8220;Mayhap, yah
won&#8217;t get anoder so willin&#8217; to go, as I&#8217;se be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. But I want a person of some experience&#8212;one who has
been used to service, and could bring a good character from her
last employer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Karaktah! Karaktah!&#8221; said the girl contemptuously. &#8220;What need of
a karaktah in such a place as Cannadah? Folk a&#8217; go there need na
karaktah, or they might jeest as well bide to whome.&#8221;</p>

<p>This last declaration settled the matter, and Flora, not without
some difficulty, got rid of the promising candidate for matrimony
and emigration. Her place was instantly supplied by a tall,
hard-featured, middle-aged woman, who had been impatiently waiting
for Miss Pack&#8217;s dismissal, in the kitchen, and who now rushed upon
the scene, followed by three rude children, from six to ten years
of age, a girl, and two impudent-looking boys, who ranged
themselves in front of Mrs. Lyndsay, with open mouths, and eyes
distended with eager curiosity, in order to attract her
observation, and indulge themselves in a downright stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my good woman, and what is your business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> with me?&#8221; said
Flora, not at all prepossessed by any of the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the mistress?&#8221; asked the woman, dropping a curtsy.</p>

<p>Flora answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&#8220;My business is to go to Canady; but I have not the means. I am a
poor widow; my husband died of the fever three years ago, and left
me with these children to drag along the best way I could. We have
had hard times, I can tell you, Ma&#8217;am, and I should be main glad
to better my condition, which I think I might do, if I could get
out to Canady. I heard that you wanted a nurse for your baby
during the voyage, and I should be glad to engage with you, if we
can agree as to the terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your terms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For you, Ma&#8217;am, to pay the passage of me and the three children
over, and I to attend upon you and the child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my good woman, I have only one little child for you to take
charge of, and you cannot expect me, for the trifling services
that you could render, to pay your passage over, and that of your
family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, you might be glad of the chance,&#8221; said the sturdy dame. &#8220;It
is not everybody that would take service with you to go there. I
should not trouble you longer than the voyage. I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> friends of
my own at Montreal, who have written for me to come out to them;
and so I would long ago, if I had had the means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they want you, they may pay your passage,&#8221; said Flora,
disgusted with the selfishness of her new acquaintance. &#8220;It would
be less trouble to me to nurse my own child, than incur the
responsibility of three that did not belong to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman collected her young barbarians from the different
quarters of the room, where they were reconnoitring the
attractions of the place, and withdrew with a scowl; and Flora&#8217;s
nurse, Mrs. Clarke, shortly after entered the room, with little
Josephine in her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, nurse,&#8221; said Flora, giving way to a hearty laugh, &#8220;did you
see those queer people, who want me to take them out as a venture
to Canada?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A losing speculation that would be, if we may judge by looks and
manners,&#8221; said the old lady; &#8220;but, indeed, Mrs. Lyndsay, it will
be no easy matter to find just what you want. It is not every one
to whom I would trust the dear baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then sitting down in the nursing chair, and hushing Josey on her
knee, she continued, &#8220;I have been thinking of you and the child a
great deal since I heard you were bent on going to Canada; and if
you think that I could be of any service to you, I would go with
you, myself. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> ask no wages&#8212;nothing of you, beyond a home for my
old age.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke was a kind, amiable, good woman, but very feeble,
nervous, and sickly, and very little qualified for the arduous and
fatiguing life she had chosen.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear nurse,&#8221; said Flora, clasping her hand in her own, &#8220;I
should only be too happy to have you. But you are old, and in
delicate health; the climate would kill you; I much doubt whether
you could stand the voyage. I cannot be so selfish as to take you
from your home and friends at your time of life. But take off your
hat and shawl, and we will talk the matter over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman laid the now sleeping babe in the cradle, and
resumed her seat with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is this want of a home which makes me anxious to go with you.
It is hard to be dependent upon the caprice of brothers, in one&#8217;s
old age. Thirty years ago and life wore for me a very different
aspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nurse,&#8221; said Flora, who was very fond of the good old body, who
had attended her with the greatest care and tenderness, through a
long and dangerous illness; &#8220;how comes it that such a pretty woman
as you must have been did not marry in your youth? I can scarcely
imagine that nature ever meant you for an old maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nature never made any woman to be an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> maid,&#8221; said Nurse; &#8220;God
does nothing in vain. Women were sent into the world to be wives
and mothers; and there are very few who don&#8217;t entertain the hope
of being so at some period of their lives. I should not be the
forlorn, desolate creature I am to-day, if I had had a snug home,
and a good husband to make the fireside cheery, and children
together about my knees, and make me feel young again, while
listening to their simple prattle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought to have been a happy wife once,&#8221; continued Nurse,
sadly; &#8220;a heavy calamity that broke another heart besides mine,
laid all my hopes in the dust, and banished from my mind the idea
of marriage for ever. Did I never tell you the story, Ma&#8217;am? A few
words will often contain the history of events that embittered a
whole life. Whilst I am hemming this little pinafore for Miss
Josey, I will tell you the tale of my early grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father was a native of this town, and captain of a small
vessel employed in the coal-trade, which plied constantly between
this port and Newcastle and Shields. He owned most of the shares
in her, was reckoned an excellent sailor, and was so fortunate as
to have escaped the usual dangers attendant upon the coast trade,
never having been wrecked in his life,&#8212;which circumstance had won
for him the nickname of &#8216;Lucky Billy,&#8217; by which he was generally
known in all the seaport towns along the coast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>&#8220;I was the eldest of a large family, and the only girl. My mother
died when I was fourteen years of age, and all the cares of the
household early devolved upon me; my father was very fond of me,
and so proud of my good looks, that his ship was christened the
<em>Pretty Betsy</em>, in honour of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father not only earned a comfortable living, but saved enough to
build those two neat stone cottages on the East-cliff. We lived in
the one which my brother now occupies; the other, which is divided
from it by a narrow alley, into which the back doors of both open,
was rented for many years by the widow of a revenue officer and
her two sons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Arthur&#8217;s husband had been killed in a fray with the
smugglers, and she enjoyed a small Government pension, which
enabled her to bring up her boys decently, and maintain a
respectable appearance. My father tried his best to induce Mrs.
Arthur to be his second wife, but she steadily refused his offer,
though the family continued to live on terms of the strictest
friendship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Arthur&#8217;s sons, John and David, were the handsomest and
cleverest lads of their class, between this and the port of Y&#8212;&mdash;.
They both followed the sea, and after serving their
apprenticeships with my father, John got the command of the
<em>Nancy</em>, a new vessel that was employed in the merchant trade, and
made short voyages between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> this and London. David, who was two
years younger, sailed with his brother as mate of the <em>Nancy</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;David and I had been sweethearts from our school-days,&#8212;from a
child in frocks and trowsers, he had always called me &#8216;his dear
little wife.&#8217; Time only strengthened our attachment to each other,
and my father and his mother were well-pleased with the match. It
was settled by all parties, that we were to be married directly
David could get captain of a ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Arthur was very proud of her sons; but David, who was by far
the handsomest of the two, was her especial favourite. I never saw
the young sailor leave the house without kissing his mother, or
return from a voyage without bringing her a present. I used to
tell him, &#8216;There was only one person he loved better than me, and
that was his mother;&#8217; and he would laugh, and say,&#8212;&#8216;Not better,
Betsy,&#8212;but &#8217;tis a different love altogether.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must confess I was rather jealous of his mother. I did not wish
him to love her less, but to love me more. Whenever he left us for
sea, he used to tell me the very last thing&#8212;&#8216;Show your love to
me, dear Betsy, by being kind to my dear old mother. When you are
my wife, I will repay it with interest.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;During his absence, I always went every day to see Mrs. Arthur,
and to render her any little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> service in my power. She was very
fond of me, always calling me &#8216;her little daughter,&#8212;her own dear
Betsy.&#8217; Her conversation was always about her sons, and David in
particular, which rendered these visits very agreeable to me, who
loved David better than anything else under heaven. He was never
out of my thoughts, I worshipped him so completely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the latter end of February that the Arthurs made their
last voyage together. David was to sail as captain, in a fine
merchant-ship, the first of May; and everything had been arranged
for our marriage, which was to take place the tenth of April; and
I was to make a bridal tour to London with my husband in the new
ship. I was wild with anticipation and delight, and would let my
work drop from my hands twenty times a-day, while building castles
for the future. No other girl&#8217;s husband would be able to rival my
husband; no home could be as happy as my home; no bride so well
beloved as me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the twentieth of March, 18&#8212;; I recollect it as well as if
it were only yesterday. The day was bright, clear, and cold, with
high winds and a very stormy sea. The <em>Nancy</em> had been expected to
make her port all that week, and Mrs. Arthur was very uneasy at
her delay. She was never happy or contented when her sons were at
sea, but in a constant fidget of anxiety and fear. She did not
like both sailing in the same vessel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> &#8216;It is too much,&#8217; she
would say&#8212;&#8216;the safety of two lives out of one family&#8212;to be
trusted to one keel.&#8217; This morning she was more fretful and
nervous than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What can these foolish boys be thinking of, Betsy, to delay
their voyage in this way? They will in all probability be caught
in the equinoctial gales. David promised me faithfully to be back
before the eighteenth. Dear me! how the wind blows! The very sound
of it is enough to chill one&#8217;s heart. What a stormy sea! I hope
they will not sail till the day after to-morrow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I felt a certain conviction in my own mind that they had
sailed, and were at that moment on the sea; but, I must confess, I
apprehended no danger. It might be that her fears hindered me from
indulging fears of my own.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t alarm yourself needlessly, dear Mother,&#8217; said I, kissing
her cold, pale cheek. &#8216;The <em>Nancy</em> is a new ship,&#8212;the lads
brave, experienced sailors. There is not the least cause for
uneasiness. They have weathered far worse gales before now. They
have, father says, the wind and tide in their favour. It is
moonlight now o&#8217; nights; and I hope we shall see them merry and
well before morning.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;God grant you may be right, Betsy! A mother&#8217;s heart is a
hot-bed of anxiety. Mine feels as heavy as lead. My dreams, too,
were none of the brightest. I thought I was tossing in an open
boat, in just such a stormy sea all night;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> and was constantly
calling on David to save me from drowning; and I awoke shrieking,
and struggling with the great billows that were dragging me down.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who cares for dreams?&#8217; I said. Hers, I would have it, was one
of good omen; for though she fought with the storm all night, she
was not drowned. So it would be with the lads: they might
encounter a gale, and get a severe buffeting, but would arrive
safe at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I wish it may be so,&#8217; she said, with a sigh. &#8216;But I felt just
the same sinking at the heart the night my husband was killed,
when there appeared no cause for uneasiness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remained all day with the old lady, trying to raise her
spirits. She paid very little attention to all my lively chat; but
would stand for hours at her back-window, that commanded a view of
the bay, gazing at the sea. The huge breakers came rolling and
toiling to the shore, filling the air with their hoarse din. A
vessel hove in sight, running under close-reefed topsails, and
made signals for a pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah!&#8217; I exclaimed joyfully; &#8216;that is Captain Penny&#8217;s old ship,
<em>Molly</em>. If she has rode out the gale, you may dismiss your fears
about the <em>Nancy</em>. They have launched the pilot-boat. See how she
dances like a feather on the waves! Why, Mother dear,&#8217; I cried,
turning to Mrs. Arthur, who was watching the boat, with the large
tears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> trickling down her cheeks, &#8216;is it not weak, almost wicked
of you, to doubt God&#8217;s providence in this way?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah! how I wish it were their vessel,&#8217; she sobbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Captain Penny&#8217;s wife and children would not thank you for that
wish,&#8217; said I. &#8216;How glad I am that the good old man is safe!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The day wore away. A long day for us both. The gale did not
increase, and Mrs. Arthur at last began to listen to reason. The
moon rose high and bright; and after seeing the old lady to her
bed, I went home to give my father and the boys their supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found father very cross for having waited so long. &#8216;What the
devil, Betsy!&#8217; cried he, &#8216;kept you so late? The lads and I have
been starving for the last hour. When girls get sweethearts they
can think of nothing else.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mrs. Arthur felt anxious about her sons, and I stayed with
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s the old fool afraid of? This cupful of wind, Penny&#8217;s old
<em>Molly</em> rode it out bravely. He told me he left the Arthurs in the
river. He thought they would be in by daybreak. Come, be quick,
girl. As I am to lose you so soon, I would make the most of you
while you belong to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;His cheerful, hearty manner helped to raise my spirits, which had
been depressed by Mrs. Arthur&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> fretful anticipations of evil. I
bustled hither and thither, laughed and sung, and cooked father&#8217;s
mess of fresh fish so much to his satisfaction, that he declared I
should make a jewel of a wife, and that he had not made up his
mind whether he would part with such a good cook. Without he
married again, he was afraid he would not get such another.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You must be quick then,&#8217; said I, &#8217;or you will not have me for
your bridesmaid. I give you just three weeks for the courtship,
for I shan&#8217;t remain single one day longer to cook the wedding
dinner for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are saucy,&#8217; said he, filling his pipe. &#8216;Davy will have to
take the helm himself, if he would keep you on the right tack.
Clear the decks now, and be off to your bed. If the gale lulls, I
shall sail early in the morning.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I removed the supper-things, and before I lighted my candle,
lingered for a few minutes at the back window, to take a last view
of the sea. It was a stormy but very beautiful night. The heavens
were without a cloud. The full moon cast broken gleams of silver
upon the restless, tossing waters, which scattered them into a
thousand fragments of dazzling brightness, as the heavy surf
rolled in thunder against the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Has the gale freshened, father?&#8217; said I, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not a bit of it. Say your prayers, Betsy, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> trust in
Providence. Your lover is as safe in his good ship to-night, as in
his bed at home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He pulled me on to his knee, and kissed me, and I went up to bed
with a lighter heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few minutes later I was fast asleep. I don&#8217;t know how long this
sleep lasted, but I awoke with hearing David Arthur calling
beneath my window. His mother&#8217;s window and mine both fronted the
cliff, and were in a line with each other. &#8216;Thank God! David is
safe!&#8217; I cried, as I sprang joyfully from my bed, and threw open
the casement.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he was sure enough, standing in the moonlight, directly
beneath the window. His norwester flung far back on his head, his
yellow curls hanging in wet masses on his shoulders, and his
clothes dripping with the salt spray. The moon shone forth on his
upturned face. He looked very pale and cold, and his eyes were
fixed intently upon his mother&#8217;s chamber-window. Before I could
speak, he cried out in his rich, manly tones&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mother, dearest mother, I am come home to you. Open the door,
and let me in!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stay, Davy, darling&#8212;stay one moment, and I will let you in.
Your mother&#8217;s asleep; but I can open the back-door with my key.
Oh! I&#8217;m so happy, so thankful, that you are safe.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I threw my clothes on as fast as I could, but my hands trembled
so from excitement, that I could scarcely fasten a string. A cold
chill was creeping through my whole frame, and, in spite of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
joy I felt, I involuntarily burst into tears. Dashing away the
unwelcome drops with the back of my hand, I bounded down the
stairs, unlocked the back-door that led into the alley, and in
another moment stood alone on the cliff.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;David, where are you?&#8217; I cried. But no David was there. I
glanced all round the wide, open space: not an object was moving
over its surface. A deep stillness reigned all around, only
interrupted by the solemn thunder of the waters, whose hollow
surging against the shore rendered the solitude of the midnight
hour more profound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again I felt those cold chills steal through me&#8212;again the
unbidden tears streamed down my cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What can have become of him?&#8217; said I, quite bewildered with
surprise and fear; &#8216;he must have got in at the back window!&#8212;I
will go to his mother&#8212;I shall find him with her!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The key I held in my hand fitted both locks: I went into Mrs.
Arthur&#8217;s, lighted the candle that I had left on her kitchen
dresser, and went up to her chamber. She started up in the bed as
I opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good God! Betsy,&#8217; she cried, &#8217;is that you? I thought I heard
David call me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And so he did,&#8217; I said; &#8216;he came under the window just now,
and called to you to let him in. I told him to wait till I could
dress myself, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> would come down and open the door. Is he not
here?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said his mother, her face turning as white as her cap;
&#8216;you must have been dreaming.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dreaming!&#8217; said I, rather indignantly; &#8216;you need not try to
persuade me out of my senses&#8212;I saw him with my own eyes!&#8212;heard
him with my own ears! and spoke to him! What else will convince
you? He has gone back to the ship for John&#8212;I will breeze up the
fire, put on the kettle, and get something cooked for their
supper. After buffeting about in this storm, they will be cold and
hungry.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Arthur soon joined me. She could not believe that I had
spoken to David, though she fancied that she had heard him
herself, and was in a fever of anxiety, pacing to and fro the
kitchen floor, and opening the door every minute to look out. I
felt almost provoked by her want of faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If the ship were in,&#8217; she muttered, &#8216;he would have been in
long ago, to tell me that all was safe. He knows how uneasy I
always am when he and his brother are away. Betsy must have been
deceived!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mother, dear&#8212;indeed, what I tell you is true!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I repeated to her for the twentieth time, perhaps, what David
had said, and described his appearance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>&#8220;Hour after hour passed away, but no well-known footstep, or
dearly loved voice, disturbed our lonely vigil. The kettle
simmered drowsily on the hob; Mrs. Arthur, tired out with
impatient fretting at her son&#8217;s delay, had thrown her apron over
her head, and was sobbing bitterly. I began to feel alarmed; a
strange fear seemed growing upon my heart, which almost led me to
doubt the evidence of my senses&#8212;to fancy, in fact, that what I
had seen might have been a dream. But, was I not there, wide
awake? Had not his mother heard him speak as well as me? though
her half-waking state had rendered the matter less distinct than
it had been to me? I was not going to be reasoned out of my sanity
in that way, because he did not choose to wait until I came down
to open the door&#8212;which I thought rather unkind, when he must be
well aware, that my anxiety for his safety must quite equal that
of his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;The red beams of the rising sun were tinging the white foam of
the billows with a flush of crimson. The gale had lulled; and I
knew that my father&#8217;s vessel sailed with the tide. I started from
my seat, Mrs. Arthur languidly raised her head&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My dear Betsy, will you just run across the cliff to the
look-out house, and ask the sailors there if the <em>Nancy</em> came in
last night? I cannot bear this suspense much longer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I might have thought of that before,&#8217; I said;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> and, without
waiting for hat or shawl, I ran with breathless speed to the
nearest station.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found one old sailor kneeling upon the bench, looking intently
through his telescope at some object at sea. My eyes followed the
direction of the glass, and I saw distinctly, about two miles
beyond the east cliff, a vessel lying dismasted upon the reef,
with the sea breaking continually over her.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What vessel is that, Ned Jones?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s the <em>Nancy</em>,&#8217; he replied, without taking his eye from the
glass. &#8216;I know her by the white stripe along her black hull.
She&#8217;s a perfect wreck, and both the brave lads are drowned.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When did this happen?&#8217; I shrieked, shaking him frantically by
the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;She struck upon the reef at half-past one this morning. Our
lads got the boat off, but too late to save the crew.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good God!&#8217; I cried, reeling back, as if struck with a bolt of
ice; and the same deadly cold shiver ran through me. &#8216;It was his
ghost, then, I saw.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_B_1" id="FNanchor_B_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_1" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noi"><a name="Footnote_B_1" id="Footnote_B_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_1"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> I have told this story exactly as it was told to me
by Flora&#8217;s nurse. The reader must judge how far the young girl&#8217;s
imagination may have deceived her. Whether as a dream, or a
reality, I have no doubt of the truth of her tale.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how I got back to Mrs. Arthur. I never knew. Or,
whether it was from me she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> learned the terrible tidings of the
death of her sons. I fell into a brain fever, and when I recovered
my senses, Mrs. Arthur had been in her grave for some weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;In thinking over the events of that fearful night, the
recollection which pained me most was, that David&#8217;s last thought
had been for his mother,&#8212;that during his death-struggle, she was
dearer to him than me. It haunted me for years. At times it haunts
me still. Whenever the wind blows a gale, and the moon shines
clear and cold, I fancy I can see him standing below my window, in
his dripping garments, and that sad pale face turned towards his
mother&#8217;s casement; and I hear him call out, in the rich, mellow
voice I loved so well,&#8212;&#8216;Mother, dearest mother, I have come home
to you. Open the door and let me in!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a dream, Nurse,&#8221; said Flora.</p>

<p>&#8220;But supposing, Mrs. Lyndsay, that it was a dream. Is it less
strange that such a dream should occur at the very moment,
perhaps, that he was drowned; and that his mother should fancy she
heard him speak as well as I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Flora, &#8220;the mystery remains the same, and, for my own
part, I never could get rid of a startling reality; because some
people choose to call it a mere coincidence. My faith embraces the
spirit of the fact, and disclaims the coincidence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> though after
all, the coincidence is the best proof of the fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This event,&#8221; continued Nurse, &#8220;cast a shadow over my life, which
no after sunshine ever dispelled. I never loved again, and gave up
all thoughts of getting married from that hour. Perhaps I was
wrong, for I refused several worthy men, who would have given me a
comfortable home; and I should not now, at my time of life, have
to go out nursing, or be dependent upon a cross brother, for the
shelter of a roof. If you will take me to Canada with you, I only
ask in return a home in my old age.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was delighted with the project, but on writing about it to
her husband, she found him unwilling to take out a feeble old
woman, who was very likely to die on the voyage; and Flora, with
reluctance, declined the good woman&#8217;s offer.</p>

<p>It happened very unfortunately for Flora, that her mother had in
her employment a girl, whose pretty feminine face and easy pliable
manners, had rendered her a great favourite in the family.
Whenever Flora visited the Hall, Hannah had taken charge of the
baby, on whom she lavished the most endearing epithets and
caresses.</p>

<p>This girl had formed an imprudent intimacy with a farm servant in
the neighbourhood, which had ended in her seduction. Her situation
rendered marriage a matter of necessity. In this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> arrangement of
the matter, it required both parties should agree; and the man,
who doubtless knew more of the girl&#8217;s real character than her
benevolent mistress, flatly refused to make her his wife. Hannah,
in an agony of rage and contrition, had confided her situation to
her mistress; and implored her not to turn her from her doors, or
she would end her misery in self-destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;She had no home,&#8221; she said, &#8220;in the wide world&#8212;and she dared not
return to her aunt, who was the only friend she had; and who,
under existing circumstances, she well knew, would never afford
her the shelter of her roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simple as this girl appeared, she knew well how to act her part;
and so won upon the compassion of Mrs. W&#8212;&mdash;, that she was
determined, if possible, to save her from ruin. Finding that Mrs.
Lyndsay had failed in obtaining a servant, she applied to her on
Hannah&#8217;s behalf, and requested, as a favour, that she would take
the forlorn creature with her to Canada.</p>

<p>Flora at first rejected the proposal in disgust: in spite of Mrs.
W&#8212;&mdash;&#8217;s high recommendation, there was something about the woman
she did not like; and much as she was inclined to pity her, she
could not reconcile herself to the idea of making her the
companion of her voyage. She could not convince herself that
Hannah was worthy of the sympathy manifested on her behalf. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
certain fawning, servility of manner, led her to imagine that she
was deceitful; and she was reluctant to entail upon herself the
trouble and responsibility which must arise from her situation,
and the scandal it might involve. But her objections were borne
down by Mrs. W&#8212;&mdash;&#8217;s earnest entreaties, to save, if possible, a
fellow creature from ruin.</p>

<p>The false notions formed by most persons in England of the state
of society in Canada, made Mrs. W&#8212;&mdash; reject, as mere bugbears,
all Flora&#8217;s fears as to the future consequences which might arise
from her taking such a hazardous step. What had she to fear from
ill-natured gossip in a barbarous country, so thinly peopled, that
settlers seldom resided within a day&#8217;s journey of each other. If
the girl was wise enough to keep her own secret, who would take
the trouble to find it out? Children were a blessing in such a
wilderness; and Hannah&#8217;s child, brought up in the family, would be
very little additional expense and trouble, and might prove a most
attached and grateful servant, forming a lasting tie of mutual
benefit between the mother and her benefactress. The mother was an
excellent worker, and, until this misfortune happened, a good and
faithful girl. She was <em>weak</em>, to be sure; but then (what a fatal
mistake) the more easily managed. Mrs. W&#8212;&mdash;was certain that Flora
would find her a perfect treasure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>All this sounded very <a name="plausible" id="plausible"></a><ins title="plausibly in original">plausible</ins> in theory, and savoured of
romance. Flora found it in the end a dismal reality. She consented
to receive the girl as her servant, who was overjoyed at the
change in her prospects; declaring that she never could do enough
for Mrs. Lyndsay, for snatching her from a life of disgrace and
infamy. And so little Josey was provided with a nurse, and Flora
with a servant.</p>

<small>THE LAST HOURS AT HOME.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">To</span> bid farewell to her mother and sisters, and the dear home of
her childhood, Flora regarded as her greatest trial. As each
succeeding day brought nearer the hour of separation, the prospect
became more intensely painful, and fraught with a thousand
melancholy anticipations, which haunted her even in sleep; and she
often awoke sick and faint at heart with the tears she had shed in
a dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh that this dreadful parting were over!&#8221; she said to her friend
Mary Parnell. &#8220;I can contemplate, with fortitude, the trials of
the future; but there is something so dreary, so utterly hopeless,
in this breaking up of kindred ties and home associations, that it
paralyses exertion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. W&#8212;&mdash;, Flora&#8217;s mother, was in the decline of life, and it was
more than probable that the separation would be for ever. This
Flora felt very grievously;&#8212;she loved her mother tenderly, and
she could not bear to leave her. Mrs. W&#8212;&mdash; was greatly attached
to her little grandchild; and, to mention the departure of the
child, brought on a paroxysm of grief.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8220;Let Josey stay with me, Flora,&#8221; said she, as she covered its
dimpled hands with kisses. &#8220;Let me not lose you both in one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! part with my child&#8212;my only child! Dearest mother, it is
impossible to grant your request. Whatever our future fortunes may
be, she must share them with us. I could not bear up against the
trials which await me with a divided heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Consider the advantage it would be to the child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the loss of both her parents?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In her exemption from hardship, and the education she would
receive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I grant all that; yet Nature points out, that the interests of a
child cannot safely be divided from those of its parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You argue selfishly, Flora. You well know the child would be much
better off with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I speak from my heart&#8212;the heart of a mother, which cannot,
without it belongs to a monster, plead against the welfare of its
child. I know how dearly you love her&#8212;how painful it is for you
to give her up; and that she would possess with you those comforts
which, for her sake, we are about to resign. But, if we leave her
behind, we part with her ever. She is too young to remember us;
and, without knowing us, how could she love us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would be taught to love you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8220;Her love would be of a very indefinite character. She would be
told that she had a father and mother in a distant land, and be
taught to mention us daily in her prayers. But where would be the
faith, the endearing confidence, the holy love, with which a
child, brought up under the parental roof, regards the authors of
its being. The love which falls like dew from heaven upon the
weary heart, which forms a balm for every sorrow, a solace for
every care,&#8212;without its refreshing influence, what would the
wealth of the world be to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora&#8217;s heart swelled, and her eyes filled with tears. The
eloquence of an angel at that moment would have failed in
persuading her to part with her child.</p>

<p>Never did these painful feelings press more heavily on Flora&#8217;s
mind, than when all was done in the way of preparation; when her
work was all finished, her trunks all packed, her little bills in
the town all paid, her faithful domestics discharged, and nothing
remained of active employment to hinder her from perpetually
brooding over the sad prospect before her.</p>

<p>She went to spend a last day at the old Hall, to bid farewell to
the old familiar haunts, endeared to her from childhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flora, you must keep up your spirits,&#8221; said her mother, kissing
her tenderly; &#8220;nor let this parting weigh too heavily upon your
heart. We shall all meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>&#8220;In heaven, I hope, Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; it is useless to hope for that. No, never again on
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always hope for the best, Flora; it is my plan. I have found it
true wisdom. Put on your bonnet, and take a ramble through the
garden and meadows; it will refresh you after so many harassing
thoughts. Your favourite trees are in full leaf, the hawthorn
hedges in blossom, and the nightingales sing every evening in the
wood-lane. You cannot feel miserable among such sights and sounds
of beauty in this lovely month of May, or you are not the same
Flora I ever knew you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, just the same faulty, impulsive, enthusiastic creature I ever
was, dear mother. No change of circumstances will, I fear, change
my nature; and the sight of these dear old haunts will only deepen
the regret I feel at bidding them adieu.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora put on her bonnet, and went forth to take a last look of
home.</p>

<p>The Hall was an old-fashioned house, large, rambling, picturesque,
and cold. It had been built in the first year of good Queen Bess.
The back part of the mansion appeared to have belonged to a period
still more remote. The building was surrounded by fine gardens,
and lawn-like meadows, and stood sheltered within a grove of noble
old trees. It was beneath the shade of these trees, and reposing
upon the velvet-like sward at their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> feet, that Flora had first
indulged in those delicious reveries&#8212;those lovely, ideal visions
of beauty and perfection&#8212;which cover with a tissue of morning
beams all the rugged highways of life. Silent bosom friends were
those dear old trees! Every noble sentiment of her soul,&#8212;every
fault that threw its baneful shadow on the sunlight of her
mind,&#8212;had been fostered, or grown upon her, in those pastoral
solitudes. Those trees had witnessed a thousand bursts of
passionate eloquence,&#8212;a thousand gushes of bitter, heart-humbling
tears. To them had been revealed all the joys and sorrows, the
hopes and fears, which she could not confide to the sneering and
unsympathising of her own sex. The solemn druidical groves were
not more holy to their imaginative and mysterious worshippers,
than were those old oaks to the young Flora.</p>

<p>Now the balmy breath of spring, as it gently heaved the tender
green masses of brilliant foliage, seemed to utter a voice of
thrilling lamentation,&#8212;a sad, soul-touching farewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Home of my childhood! must I see you no more?&#8221; sobbed Flora. &#8220;Are
you to become to-morrow a vision of the past? O that the glory of
spring was not upon the earth! that I had to leave you amid
winter&#8217;s chilling gloom, and not in this lovely, blushing month of
May! The emerald green of these meadows&#8212;the gay flush of these
bright blossoms&#8212;the joyous song of these glad birds&#8212;breaks my
heart!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>And the poor emigrant sank down amid the green grass, and, burying
her face among the fragrant daisies, imprinted a passionate kiss
upon the sod, which was never, in time or eternity, to form a
resting-place for her again.</p>

<p>But a beam is in the dark cloud even for thee, poor Flora; thou
heart-sick lover of nature. Time will reconcile thee to the change
which now appears so dreadful. The human flowers destined to
spring around thy hut in that far off wilderness, will gladden thy
bosom in the strange land to which thy course now tends; and the
image of God, in his glorious creation, will smile upon thee as
graciously in the woods of Canada, as it now does, in thy English
Paradise. Yes, the hour will come, when you shall exclaim with
fervour,</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, I am the denizen of a free land; a land of beauty and
progression. A land unpolluted by the groans of starving millions.
A land which opens her fostering arms to receive and restore to
his long lost birthright, the trampled and abused child of
poverty: to bid him stand up a free inheritor of a free soil, who
so long laboured for a scanty pittance of bread, as an ignorant
and degraded slave, in the country to which you now cling with
such passionate fondness, and leave with such heart-breaking
<a name="quote3" id="quote3"></a><ins title="omitted &#8221; in original">regret.&#8221;</ins></p>

<p>When Flora returned from an extensive ramble through all her
favourite walks, she was agreeably surprised to find her husband
conversing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> with Mrs. W&#8212;&mdash; in the parlour. The unexpected sight
of her husband, who had returned to cheer her some days sooner
than the one he had named in his letters, soon restored Flora&#8217;s
spirits, and the sorrows of the future were forgotten in the joy
of the present.</p>

<p>Lyndsay had a thousand little incidents and anecdotes to relate of
his visit to the great metropolis; to which Flora was an eager and
delighted listener. He told her that he had satisfactorily
arranged all his pecuniary matters; and without sacrificing his
half-pay, was able to take out about three hundred pounds
sterling, which he thought, prudently managed, would enable him to
make a tolerably comfortable settlement in Canada,&#8212;particularly,
as he would not be obliged to purchase a farm, being entitled to a
grant of four hundred acres of wild land.</p>

<p>He had engaged a passage in a fine vessel that was to sail from
Leith, at the latter end of the week.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found, that in going from Scotland,&#8221; said Lyndsay, &#8220;we could be
as well accommodated for nearly half price; and it would give you
the opportunity of seeing Edinburgh, and me the melancholy
satisfaction of taking a last look at the land of my birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the London steamers will call for us to-morrow morning, on
her way to Scotland, and I must hire a boat to-night, and get our
luggage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> prepared for a start. A short notice, dear Flora, to a
sad but inevitable necessity, I thought better for a person of
your temperament, than a long and tedious anticipation of evil.
Now all is prepared for the voyage, delay is not only useless, but
dangerous. So cheer up, darling, and be as happy and cheerful as
you can. Let us spend the last night at home pleasantly together.&#8221;
He kissed Flora so affectionately, as he ceased speaking, that she
not only promised obedience, but contrived to smile through her
tears.</p>

<p>It was necessary for them to return instantly to the cottage, and
Flora took leave of her mother, with a full heart. We will not
dwell on such partings; they</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">&#8220;Wring the blood from out young hearts,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">as the poet has truly described them, making the snows of
age descend upon the rose crowned brow of youth.</p>

<p>Sorrowfully Flora returned to her pretty little cottage, which
presented a scene of bustle and confusion baffling description.
Everything was out of place and turned upside down. Corded trunks
and packages filled up the passages and doorways; and formed
<a name="stumbling" id="stumbling"></a><ins title="stumblingblocks in original">stumbling blocks</ins> for kind friends and curious neighbours, who
crowded the house. Strange dogs forced their way in after their
masters, and fought and yelped in undisturbed pugnacity. The baby
cried, and no one was at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> leisure to pacify her, and a cheerless
and uncomfortable spirit filled the once peaceful and happy home.</p>

<p>Old Captain Kitson was in his glory; hurrying here and there,
ordering, superintending, and assisting the general confusion,
without in the least degree helping on the work. He had taken upon
himself the charge of hiring the boat which was to convey the
emigrants on board the steamer; and he stood chaffering on the
lawn for a couple of hours with the sailors, to whom she belonged,
to induce them to take a shilling less than the sum proposed.</p>

<p>Tired with the altercation, and sorry for the honest tars, Lyndsay
told the master of the boat to yield to the old Captain&#8217;s terms,
and he would make up the difference. The sailor answered with a
knowing wink, and appeared reluctantly to consent to old Kitson&#8217;s
wishes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Mrs. Lyndsay, my dear, I told you these fellows would come
to my terms rather than lose a good customer,&#8221; cried the old man,
rubbing his hands together in an ecstasy of self-gratulation.
&#8220;Leave me to make a bargain; the rogues cannot cheat me with their
damned impositions. The <em>Leaftenant</em> is too soft with these chaps;
I&#8217;m an old sailor&#8212;they can&#8217;t come over me. I have made them take
one <em>pound</em> for the use of their craft, instead of <em>one and
twenty</em> shillings. &#8216;Take care of the pence,&#8217; my dear, &#8216;and the
pounds will take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> care of themselves.&#8217; I found that out, long
before poor Richard marked it down in his log.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then <a name="sidling" id="sidling"></a><ins title="sideling in original">sidling</ins> up to Flora, and putting his long nose into her face,
he whispered in her ear,&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear gall, don&#8217;t be offended with an old friend; but if
you have any old coats or hats that <em>Leaftenant</em> Lyndsay does not
think worth packing up, I shall be very glad of them, for my
Charles. Mrs. K. is an excellent hand at transmogrifying things,
and in a large family such articles never come amiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles was the Captain&#8217;s youngest son. A poor idiot, who, thirty
years of age, had the appearance of an overgrown boy. The other
members of the Captain&#8217;s <em>large</em> family were all married and
settled prosperously in the world. Flora felt truly ashamed of the
old man&#8217;s meanness, but was glad to repay his trifling services in
a way suggested by himself. The weather for the last three weeks
had been unusually fine, but towards the evening of this memorable
30th of May, large masses of clouds began to rise in the
north-west, and the sea changed its azure hue to a dull leaden
grey. Old Kitson shook his head prophetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a change of weather at hand, Mrs. Lyndsay; you may look
out for squalls before six o&#8217;clock to-morrow. The wind shifts
every minute, and there&#8217;s an ugly swell rolling in upon the
shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I hope it will be fine,&#8221; said Flora, looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> anxiously up at
the troubled sky; &#8220;it is so miserable to begin a long journey in
the rain. Perhaps it will pass off during the night in a
thunder-shower.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man whistled, shut one eye, and looked knowingly at the
sea with the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Women know about as much of the weather as your nurse does of
handling a rope. Whew! but there&#8217;s a gale coming; I&#8217;ll down to the
beach, and tell the lads to haul up the boats, and make all snug
before it bursts,&#8221; and away toddled the old man, full of the
importance of his mission.</p>

<p>It was the last night at home&#8212;the last social meeting of kindred
friends on this side the grave. Flora tried to appear cheerful,
but the forced smile upon the tutored lips, rendered doubly
painful the tears kept back in the swollen eyes; the vain effort
of the sorrowful in heart to be gay. Alas! for the warm hearts,
the generous friendships, the kindly greetings of dear Old
England, when would they be hers again? Flora&#8217;s friends at length
took leave, and she was left with her husband alone.</p>

<small>THE DEPARTURE.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the dawn of day when Flora started from a broken, feverish
sleep, aroused to consciousness by the heavy roaring of the sea,
as the huge billows thundered against the stony beach. To spring
from her bed and draw back the curtains of the window which
commanded a full view of the bay, was but the work of a moment.
How quickly she let it fall in despair over the cheerless prospect
it presented to her sight! Far as the eye could reach the sea was
covered with foam. Not a sail was visible, and a dark leaden sky
was pouring down torrents of rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a morning!&#8221; she muttered to herself, as she stole quietly
back to bed. &#8220;It will be impossible to put to sea to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sleep which had shunned her pillow during the greater part of
the night, gently stole over her, and &#8220;wrapped her senses in
forgetfulness;&#8221; and old Kitson, two hours later, twice threw a
pebble against the window, before she awoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Leaftenant</em> Lyndsay&#8212;<em>Leaftenant</em> Lyndsay!&#8221; shouted the Captain,
in a voice like a speaking-trumpet&#8212;&#8220;wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> and tide wait for no
man. Up, up, and be doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay,&#8221; responded Lyndsay, rubbing his eyes, and going to the
window.</p>

<p>&#8220;See what a storm the night has been brewing for you,&#8221; continued
old Kitson. &#8220;It blows great guns, and there&#8217;s rain enough to float
Noah&#8217;s ark. Waters is here, and wants to see you. He says that his
small craft won&#8217;t live in a sea like this. You&#8217;ll have to put off
your voyage till the steamer takes her next trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad,&#8221; said Lyndsay, hurrying on his clothes, and joining
the old sailor on the lawn. &#8220;Is there any chance, Kitson, of this
holding up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None. This is paying us off for three weeks fine weather, and may
last for several days&#8212;at all events, till night. The steamer will
be rattling down in an hour, with the wind and tide in her favour.
Were you once on board, <em>Leaftenant</em>, you might snap your fingers
at this capful of wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must make up our minds to lose our places,&#8221; said Lyndsay, in a
tone of deep <a name="vexation" id="vexation"></a><ins title="fullstop added">vexation.</ins></p>

<p>&#8220;You have taken your places then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and made a deposit of half the passage money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Now, <em>Leaftenant</em> Lyndsay, that&#8217;s a thing I never do. I
always take my chance. I would rather lose my place in a boat, or
a coach, than lose my money. But young fellows like you never
learn wisdom. Experience is all thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> away upon you. But as we
can&#8217;t remedy the evil now, we had better step in and get a morsel
of breakfast. This raw air makes one hungry. The wind may lull by
that time.&#8221; Then gazing at the sky with one of his keen orbs,
while he shaded with his hand the other, he continued&#8212;&#8220;It rains
too hard for it to blow long at this rate; and the season of the
year is all in your favour. Go in&#8212;go in, and get something to
eat, and we will settle over your wife&#8217;s good coffee what is best
to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyndsay thought with the Captain, that the storm would abate, and
he returned to the anxious Flora, to report the aspect of things
without.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a bad omen,&#8221; said Flora, pouring out the coffee. &#8220;If we may
judge of the future by the present&#8212;it looks dark enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t provoke me into anger, Flora, by talking in such a childish
manner, and placing reliance upon an exploded superstition. Women
are so fond of prognosticating evil, that I believe they are
disappointed if it does not happen as they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, reason may find fault with us if she will,&#8221; said Flora;
&#8220;but we are all more or less influenced by these mysterious
presentiments; and suffer trifling circumstances to give a
colouring for good or evil to the passing hour. My dear, cross
philosopher, hand me the toast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora&#8217;s defence of her favourite theory was interrupted by the
arrival of two very dear friends,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> who had come from a distance,
through the storm, to bid her good-bye.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawke, the elder of the twain, was an author of considerable
celebrity in his native county, and a most kind and excellent man.
He brought with him his second son, a fine lad of twelve years of
age, to place under Lyndsay&#8217;s charge. James Hawke had taken a
fancy to settle in Canada, and a friend of the family, who was
located in the Backwoods of that far region, had written to his
father, that he would take the lad, and initiate him in the
mysteries of the axe, if he could find a person to bring him over.
Lyndsay had promised to do this, and the boy, who had that morning
parted with his mother and little brothers and sisters, for the
first time in his life, in spite of the elastic spirits of youth,
looked sad and dejected.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawke&#8217;s companion was a young Quaker, who had known Flora from
a girl, and had always expressed the greatest interest in her
welfare.</p>

<p>Adam Mansel was a handsome, talented man, whose joyous
disposition, and mirthful humour, could scarcely be trammelled
down by the severe conventional rules of the Society to which he
belonged. Adam&#8217;s exquisite taste for music, and his great
admiration for horses and dogs, savoured rather of the camp of the
enemy. But his love for these forbidden carnalities was always
kept within bounds, and only known to a few very particular
friends.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;Friend Flora,&#8221; he said, taking her hand, and giving it a most
hearty and cordial shake, &#8220;this is a sad day to those who have
known thee long, and loved thee well; and a foul day for the
commencement of such an important journey. Bad <a name="beginnings" id="beginnings"></a><ins title="beginings in original">beginnings</ins>, they
say, make bright endings; so there is hope for thee yet in the
stormy cloud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flora, where are your omens now?&#8221; said Lyndsay, triumphantly.
&#8220;Either you or friend Adam must be wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or the proverb I quoted, say rather,&#8221; returned Adam. &#8220;Proverbs
often bear a double meaning, and can be interpreted as well one
way as the other. The ancients were cunning fellows in this
respect, and were determined to make themselves true prophets at
any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a miserable day,&#8221; said the poet, turning from the window,
where he had been contemplating thoughtfully the gloomy aspect of
things without. His eye fell sadly upon his son. &#8220;It is enough to
chill the heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was a boy at school,&#8221; said Adam, &#8220;I used to think that God
sent all the rain upon holidays, on purpose to disappoint us of
our sport. I found that most things in life happened contrary to
our wishes; and I used to pray devoutly, that all the Saturdays
might prove wet, firmly believing that it would be sure to turn
out the reverse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;According to your theory, Mansel,&#8221; said Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> Hawke, &#8220;Mrs. Lyndsay
must have prayed for a very fine day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dost thee call this a holiday?&#8221; returned the Quaker, with a
twinkle of quiet humour in his bright brown eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawke suppressed a sigh, and his glance again fell on his boy;
and, hurrying to the window, he mechanically drew his hand across
his eyes.</p>

<p>Here the old Captain came bustling in, full of importance,
chuckling, rubbing his hands, and shaking his dripping fearnaught,
with an air of great satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not be disappointed, my dear,&#8221; addressing himself to
Mrs. Lyndsay. &#8220;The wind has fallen off a bit; and, though the sea
is too rough for the small craft, Palmer, the captain of the
pilot-boat, has been with me; and, for the consideration of two
pounds (forty shillings),&#8212;a large sum of money, by-the-bye,&#8212;I
will try and beat him down to thirty,&#8212;he says he will launch the
great boat, and man her with twelve stout young fellows, who will
take you, bag and baggage, on board the steamer, though the gale
were blowing twice as stiff. You have no more to fear in that fine
boat, than you have sitting at your ease in that arm-chair. So
make up your mind, my dear; for you have no time to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora looked anxiously from her husband to her child, and then at
the black, pouring sky, and the raging waters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>&#8220;There is no danger, Flora,&#8221; said Lyndsay. &#8220;These fine boats can
live in almost any sea. But the rain will make it very
uncomfortable for you and the child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The discomfort will only last a few minutes, Mrs. Lyndsay,&#8221; said
old Kitson. &#8220;Those chaps will put you on board before you can say
Jack Robinson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is better to bear a ducking than lose our passage in the
<em>Chieftain</em>,&#8221; said Flora. &#8220;There cannot be much to apprehend from
the violence of the storm, or twelve men would never risk their
lives for the value of forty shillings. Our trunks are all in the
boat-house, our servants discharged, and our friends gone; we have
no longer a home, and I am impatient to commence our voyage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Flora. Dress yourself and the child, and I will
engage the boat immediately.&#8221; And away bounded Lyndsay to make
their final arrangements, and see the luggage safely stowed away
in the pilot-boat.</p>

<p>Captain Kitson seated himself at the table, and began discussing a
beefsteak with all the earnestness of a hungry man. From time to
time, as his appetite began to slacken, he addressed a word of
comfort or encouragement to Mrs. Lyndsay, who was busy wrapping up
the baby for her perilous voyage.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, my dear. Take care of the young one; &#8217;tis the most
troublesome piece of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> lumber you have with you. A child and a cat
are two things which never ought to come on board a ship. But take
courage, my dear. Be like our brave Nelson; never look behind you
after entering upon difficulties; it only makes bad worse, and
does no manner of good. You will encounter rougher gales than this
before you have crossed the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that we shall not have to wait long for the steamer,&#8221; said
Flora. &#8220;I dread this drenching rain for the poor babe, far more
than the stormy sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; responded the old man, &#8220;the steamer will be rattling down
in no time; it is within an hour of her usual time. But Mrs.
Lyndsay, my dear,&#8221;&#8212;hastily pushing from him his empty plate, and
speaking with his mouth full&#8212;&#8220;I have one word to say to you in
private, before you go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora followed the gallant captain into the kitchen, marvelling in
her own mind what this private communication could be. The old man
shut the door carefully behind him; then said, in a mysterious
whisper&#8212;&#8220;The old clothes; do you remember what I said to you last
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, Flora looked down, coloured, and hesitated; she
was afraid of wounding his feelings. Simple woman! the man was
without delicacy, and had no feelings to wound.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a bundle of things, Captain Kitson,&#8221; she faltered out at
last, &#8220;in the press in my bedroom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> for Mr. Charles&#8212;coats,
trowsers, and other things. I was ashamed to mention to you such
trifles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind&#8212;never mind, my dear; I am past blushing at my time of
life; and reelly&#8212;(he always called it reelly)&#8212;I am much obliged
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a pause, in which both looked supremely foolish, the old man
continued&#8212;&#8220;There was a china cup and two plates&#8212;pity to spoil
the set&#8212;that your careless maid broke the other day in the
washhouse. Did Mrs. K. mention them to you, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, and they are <em>paid</em> for,&#8221; said Flora, turning with
disgust from the sordid old man. &#8220;Have you anything else to
communicate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the Captain. &#8220;Here is your husband looking for
you. The boat is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flora, we only wait for you,&#8221; said Lyndsay. Flora placed the
precious babe in her father&#8217;s arms, and they descended the steep
flight of steps that led from the cliff to the beach.</p>

<p>In spite of the inclemency of the weather a crowd of old and young
had assembled on the beach to witness their embarcation, and bid
them farewell.</p>

<p>The hearty &#8220;God bless you! God grant you a prosperous voyage, and
a better home than the one you leave, on the other side of the
Atlantic!&#8221; burst from the lips of many an honest tar; and brought
the tears into Flora&#8217;s eyes, as the sailors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> crowded round the
emigrants, to shake hands with them before they stepped into the
noble boat that lay rocking in the surf.</p>

<p>Precious to Flora and Lyndsay were the pressure of those hard
rough hands. They expressed the honest sympathy felt, by a
true-hearted set of poor men, in their present situation and
future welfare.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going without one parting word with me!&#8221; cried Mary
Parnell, springing down the steep bank of stones, against which
thundered the tremendous surf. The wind had blown her straw bonnet
back upon her shoulders, and scattered her fair hair in beautiful
confusion round her lovely face.</p>

<p>The weeping, agitated girl was alternately clasped in the arms of
Lyndsay and his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you expose yourself, dear Mary, to weather like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk of weather,&#8221; sobbed Mary; &#8220;I only know that we must
part. Do you begrudge me the last look? Good-bye! God bless you
both!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Flora could speak another word, she was caught up in the
arms of a stout seaman, who safely deposited both the mother and
her child in the boat. Lyndsay, Mr. Hawke, his son, Adam Mansel,
and lastly Hannah, followed. Three cheers arose from the sailors
on the beach. The gallant boat dashed through the surf, and was
soon bounding over the giant billows.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>Mr. Hawke and friend Adam had never been on the sea before, but
they determined not to bid adieu to the emigrants until they saw
them safe on board the steamer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will never take a last look of the dear home in which I have
passed so many happy hours,&#8221; said Flora, resolutely turning her
back to the shore. &#8220;I cannot yet realize the thought that I am
never to see it again.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>AN OPEN BOAT AT SEA.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Flora&#8217;s</span> spirits rose in proportion to the novelty and danger of
her situation. All useless regrets and repinings were banished
from her breast the moment she embarked upon that stormy ocean.
The parting, which, when far off, had weighed so heavily on her
heart, was over; the present was full of excitement and interest;
the time for action had arrived; and the consciousness that they
were actually on their way to a distant clime, braced her mind to
bear with becoming fortitude this great epoch of her life.</p>

<p>The gale lulled for a few minutes, and Flora looked up to the
leaden sky, in the hope of catching one bright gleam from the sun.
He seemed to have abdicated his throne that day, and refused to
cast even a glimpse upon the dark, storm-tossed waters, or cheer
with his presence the departure of the emigrants.</p>

<p>The gentlemen made an effort to be lively. The conversation turned
on the conduct of women under trying circumstances&#8212;the courage
and constancy they had shown in situations of great
peril&#8212;animating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> the men to fresh exertions by their patient
endurance of suffering and privation. Mr. Hawke said, &#8220;That all
travellers had agreed in their observations upon the conduct of
females to strangers; and that, when travelling, they had never
had occasion to complain of the women.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this speech, Lyndsay, who began to feel all the horrible nausea
of sea-sickness, raised his head from between his hands, and
replied with a smile, &#8220;That it was the very reverse with women,
for, when they travelled, they had most reason to complain of the
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>The effects of the stormy weather soon became very apparent among
the passengers in the pilot-boat&#8212;sickness laid its leaden grasp
upon all the fresh-water sailors. Even Lyndsay, a hardy Islander,
and used to boats and boating all his life, yielded passively to
the attacks of the relentless fiend of the salt waters, with rigid
features, and a face pale as the faces of the dead. He sat with
his head bowed between his hands, as motionless as if he had
suddenly been frozen into stone. Flora often lifted the cape of
the cloak which partially concealed his face, to ascertain that he
was still alive.</p>

<p>The anxiety she felt in endeavouring to protect her infant from
the pouring rain, perhaps acted as an antidote to this distressing
malady, for, though only just out of a sick bed, she did not feel
the least qualmish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>Hannah, the servant, lay stretched at the bottom of the boat, her
head supported by the ballast-bags, in a state too miserable to
describe; while James Hawke, the lad who was to accompany them in
their long voyage, had sunk into a state of happy unconsciousness,
after having vainly wished, for the hundredth time, that he was
safe on shore, scampering over the village green with his twelve
brothers and sisters, and not tempting the angry main in an open
boat, with the windows of heaven discharging waters enough upon
his defenceless head to drown him&#8212;without speaking of the big
waves that every moment burst into the boat, giving him a salt
bath upon a gigantic scale.</p>

<p>After an hour&#8217;s hard rowing, the <em>King William</em> (for so their boat
was called), cast anchor in the roadstead, distant about eight
miles from the town, and lay to, waiting for the coming-up of the
steamer.</p>

<p>Hours passed away,&#8212;the day wore slowly onward,&#8212;but still the
vessel they expected did not appear. The storm, which had lulled
till noon, increased in violence, until it blew &#8220;great guns,&#8221; to
use the sailors&#8217; nautical phraseology; and signs of uneasiness
began to be manifested by the hardy crew of the pilot-boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some accident must have befallen the steamer,&#8221; said Palmer, the
captain of the boat, to Craigie, a fine, handsome young seaman, as
he handed him the bucket to bale the water from their vessel. &#8220;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
don&#8217;t like this; I&#8217;ll be &#8212;&mdash; if I do! If the wind increases, and
remains in the present quarter, a pretty kettle of fish it will
make of us. We may be thankful if we escape with our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any danger?&#8221; demanded Flora eagerly, as she clasped her
wet, cold baby closer to her breast. The child had been crying
piteously for the last hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Madam,&#8221; he replied respectfully; &#8220;we have been in
considerable danger all day. The wind is increasing with the
coming in of the tide; and I see no prospect of its clearing up.
As the night comes on, do ye see, and if we do not fall in with
the <em>Soho</em>, we shall have to haul up the anchor, and run before
the gale; and, with all my knowledge of the coast, we may be
driven ashore, and the boat swamped in the surf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora sighed, and wished herself safe at home, in her dear, snug,
little parlour; the baby asleep in the cradle, and Lyndsay reading
aloud to her as she worked, or playing on his flute.</p>

<p>The rain again burst down in torrents,&#8212;the thunder roared over
their heads,&#8212;and the black, lurid sky, looked as if it contained
a second deluge. Flora shivered with cold and exhaustion, and bent
more closely over the child, to protect her as much as possible,
by the exposure of her own person, from the drenching rain and
spray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! this is sad work for women and children!&#8221; said the honest
tar, drawing a large tarpaulin over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> the mother and child. Blinded
and drenched by the pelting of the pitiless shower, Flora crouched
down in the bottom of the boat, in patient endurance of what might
befal. The wind blew piercingly cold; and the spray of the huge
billows which burst continually over them, enveloped the small
craft in a feathery cloud, effectually concealing from her weary
passengers the black waste of raging waters which roared around
and beneath them.</p>

<p>The poor infant was starving with hunger, and all Flora&#8217;s efforts
to keep it quiet proved unavailing. The gentlemen were as sick and
helpless as the baby, and nothing could well increase their
wretchedness. They had now been ten hours at sea; and, not
expecting the least detention from the non-arrival of the steamer,
nothing in the way of refreshment had formed any part of their
luggage. Those who had escaped the horrors of sea-sickness, of
which Flora was one, were suffering from thirst, while the keen
air had sharpened their appetites to a ravenous degree.</p>

<p>In spite of their forlorn situation, Flora could not help being
amused by the gay, careless manner, in which the crew of the boat
contended with these difficulties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be blowed if I arn&#8217;t hungry!&#8221; cried Craigie, as he
stood up in the boat, with his arms folded, and his nor&#8217;wester
pulled over his eyes, to ward off the drenching rain. &#8220;Nothin&#8217;
would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> come amiss to me now, in the way of prog. I could digest a
bit of the shark that swallowed Jonah, or pick a rib of the old
prophet himself, without making a wry face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder which would prove the tougher morsel of the two,&#8221; said
Mr. Hawke, raising his languid head from the bench before him, and
whose love of fun overcame the deadly pangs of sea-sickness.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dish of good beefsteaks from the Crown Inn would be worth them
both, friend,&#8221; said Adam Mansel, who, getting better of the
sea-sickness, like Craigie, began to feel the pangs of hunger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may keep the dish, mister,&#8221; returned Craigie, laughing; &#8220;give
me the grub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, how bitter!&#8221; groaned James Hawke, raising himself up from the
furled sail which had formed his bed, and yielding to the terrible
nausea that oppressed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, my lad,&#8221; said an ancient mariner, on whose tanned face
time and exposure to sun and storm had traced a thousand
hieroglyphics; &#8220;nothing&#8217;s sweet that&#8217;s so contrary to natur&#8217;.
Among the bitter things of life, there&#8217;s scarcely a worse than the
one that now troubles you. Sick at sea,&#8212;well on shore; so there&#8217;s
comfort for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold comfort,&#8221; sighed the boy, as he again fell prostrate on the
wet sail. A huge billow broke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> over the side of the boat, and
deluged him with brine. He did not heed it, having again relapsed
into his former insensible state.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bucket aft,&#8221; shouted Palmer. &#8220;It&#8217;s wanted to bale the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The bucket&#8217;s engaged,&#8221; said Craigie, bowing with ludicrous
politeness, to poor Hannah, whose head he was supporting, &#8220;I must
first attend to the lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>The patience of the handsome young <a name="quaker" id="quaker"></a><ins title="original had quaker">Quaker</ins>, under existing
difficulties, was highly amusing. He bore the infliction of the
prevailing malady with such a benign air of resignation, that it
was quite edifying. Wiping the salt water from his face with a
pocket-handkerchief of snowy whiteness, he exclaimed, turning to
Flora, who was sitting at his feet with Josey in her arms, &#8220;Friend
Flora, this sea-sickness is an evil emetic. It tries a man&#8217;s
temper, and makes him guilty of the crime of wishing himself at
the bottom of the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could rap out a good round oath or two, Mister Quaker,
without choking yourself, it would do you a power of good,&#8221; said
Craigie. &#8220;What&#8217;s the use of a big man putting up with the like o&#8217;
that, like a weak gall&#8212;women were made to bear&#8212;man to resist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Devil, and he will flee from them,&#8221; said Adam.</p>

<p>&#8220;You smooth-faced, unshaved fellows, have him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> always at your
elbow,&#8221; said Craigie. &#8220;He teaches you long prayers&#8212;us big oaths.
I wonder which cargo is the best to take to heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two blacks don&#8217;t make a white, friend,&#8221; said Adam,
good-naturedly. &#8220;Blasphemy, or hypocrisy either, is sufficient to
sink the ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>Night was now fast closing over the storm-tossed voyagers. The
boat was half full of water, which flowed over Flora&#8217;s lap, and
she began to feel very apprehensive for the safety of her child.
At this moment, a large retriever dog which belonged to the
captain of the boat, crept into her lap; and she joyfully placed
the baby upon his shaggy back, and the warmth of the animal seemed
greatly to revive the poor shivering Josey.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when Palmer roused Lyndsay from his stupor, and
suggested the propriety of their return to &#8212;&mdash;. &#8220;You see, Sir,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I am quite willing to wait for the arrival of the
<em>Soho</em>, but something must have gone wrong with her, or she would
have been down before this. The crew of the boat have been now ten
hours exposed to the storm, without a morsel of food, and if the
wind should change, we should have to run in for the Port of
Y&#8212;&mdash;, twenty miles distant from this. Under existing
circumstances, I think it advisable to return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; said Lyndsay. &#8220;This might have been done three
hours ago;&#8221; and the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> minute, to Flora&#8217;s inexpressible joy,
the anchor was hoisted, and the gallant boat once more careering
over the mighty billows.</p>

<p>Her face was once more turned towards that dear home, to which she
had bidden adieu in the morning; as she then imagined, for
ever&#8212;&#8220;England&#8221;&#8212;she cried, stretching her arms towards the dusky
shore. &#8220;Dear England! The winds and waves forbid our leaving you.
Welcome,&#8212;oh, welcome, once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they neared the beach, the stormy clouds parted in rifted
masses; and the deep blue heavens, studded here and there with a
pale star, gleamed lovingly down upon them; the rain ceased its
pitiless pelting, the very elements seemed to smile upon their
return.</p>

<p>The pilot boat had been reported during the day as lost, and the
beach was crowded with anxious men and women to hail its return.
The wives and children of her crew pressed forward to meet them
with joyful acclamations; and Flora&#8217;s depressed spirits rose with
the excitement of the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold fast your baby, Mrs. Lyndsay, while the boat clears the
surf,&#8221; cried Palmer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll warrant that you both get a fresh
ducking.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the noble boat cut like an arrow through the line of
formidable breakers which thundered on the beach; the foam flew in
feathery volumes high above their heads, drenching them with a
misty shower; the keel grated upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> shingles, and a strong arm
lifted Flora once more upon her native land.</p>

<p>Benumbed and cramped with their long immersion in salt water, her
limbs had lost the power of motion, and Lyndsay and old Kitson
carried her between them up the steps which led from the beach to
the top of the cliffs, and deposited her safely on the sofa in the
little parlour of her deserted home.</p>

<small>ONCE MORE AT HOME.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">A cheerful</span> fire was blazing in the grate; the fragrant tea was
smoking on the well-covered table, and dear and familiar voices
rang in her ears, as sisters and friends crowded about Flora to
offer their services, and congratulate her on her safe return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, does not this repay us for all our past sufferings?&#8221; cried
Flora, after the first hearty salutations of her friends were
over. &#8220;And the baby! where is the baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>Josey was laughing and crowing in the arms of her old nurse,
looking as fresh and as rosy as if nothing had happened to disturb
her repose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome once more to old England! dear Flora,&#8221; said Mary Parnell,
kissing the cold, wet cheek of her friend. &#8220;When I said that we
should meet again, I did not think that it would be so soon. Thank
God, you are all safe! For many hours it was believed that the
boat had been swamped in the gale, and that you were all lost. You
may imagine the distress of your mother and sisters, and the
anguish the report<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> occasioned us all, and how we rejoiced when
Waters ran up with the blessed news that the boat was returning,
and that her crew was safe. But come up-stairs, my Flora, and
change these dripping clothes. There is a nice fire in your
bedroom, and I have provided everything necessary for your
comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk of her changing her clothes, Miss Parnell,&#8221; said the
old Captain, bustling in. &#8220;Undress and put her to bed immediately,
between hot blankets, and I will make her a good stiff glass of
brandy-and-water, to drive the cold out of her, or she may fall
into a sickness which no doctor can cure. Cut your yarn short, I
say, or I shall have to take charge of her myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Kitson is right, Mary,&#8221; said Lyndsay, who just then
entered from superintending the removal of his luggage from the
boat, accompanied by a group of friends, all anxious to
congratulate Mrs. Lyndsay on her providential escape. &#8220;My dear
Flora, you must be a good girl, and go instantly to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be so dull&#8221;&#8212;and Flora glanced at the group of friendly
faces, beaming with affection and kindness; &#8220;I should enjoy myself
here so much. Now, John, do not send me away to bed, and keep all
the fun to yourself&#8212;the bright, cheery fire and all the good
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyndsay looked grave, and whispered something in her ear about the
baby, and the madness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> risking a bad cold. Whatever was the
exact import of his communication, it had the effect of producing
immediate obedience to his wishes, and Flora reluctantly quitted
the social group, and retired to her own chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mary,&#8221; she said, as Miss Parnell safely deposited her and the
precious baby between the hot blankets, &#8220;it was worth braving a
thousand storms to receive such a welcome back. I never knew how
much our dear kind friends loved us before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now we have got you safe back, Flora, who knows what may
happen to prevent your leaving us again; Lyndsay may change his
mind, and prefer being happy on a small income at home to seeking
his fortune in a strange land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know him better than you do, Mary. When once he has made up his
mind to any step which he considers necessary, a little difficulty
and danger will only stimulate him to exertion, and make him more
eager to prosecute his voyage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whilst sipping the potion prescribed by old Kitson, and giving
Mary an account of all the perils they had encountered during the
day, Nurse came running up-stairs to say that Captain Kitson
thought that the <em>Soho</em> was just rounding the point off the cliff,
and he wanted to know, that if it really proved to be her, whether
Mrs. Lyndsay would get up and once more trust herself upon the
waves?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>&#8220;Not to-night, Nurse, if a fortune depended upon it,&#8221; said Flora,
laughing. &#8220;Tell the Captain that I have spent the day in a
salt-bath, and mean to pass the night in my bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mrs. Lyndsay was not put to this fresh trial. The
Captain had mistaken the craft, and she was permitted to enjoy the
warmth and comfort of a sound sleep, unbroken by the peals of
laughter, that from time to time ascended from the room beneath;
where the gentlemen seemed determined to make the night recompense
them for the dangers and privations of the day.</p>

<p>The morning brought its own train of troubles&#8212;and when do they
ever come singly? Upon examination, Lyndsay found that the
salt-water had penetrated into all their trunks and cases; and
that everything would have to be unpacked and hung out to dry.
This was indeed dull work, the disappointment and loss attending
upon it rendering it doubly irksome.</p>

<p>While Flora and her friend Mary superintended this troublesome
affair, Lyndsay lost no time in writing to the steamboat company,
informing them of his disastrous attempt to meet the <em>Soho</em>; and
the loss he had incurred by missing the vessel. They stated in
reply, that the boat had been wrecked at the mouth of the Thames,
in the gale; and that another boat would supply her place on the
Sunday following; that she would pass the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> town at noon, and hoist
a red flag at her stern, as a signal for them to get on board.</p>

<p>This was Thursday, and the intervening days passed heavily along.
A restless fever of expectation preyed upon Flora. She could
settle to no regular occupation; she knew that the delay only
involved a fresh and heavy expense, that they must ultimately go,
and she longed to be off. The efforts made by her friends to amuse
and divert her, only increased her impatience. But time, however
slowly it passes to the anxious expectant, swiftly and surely
ushers in the appointed day.</p>

<p>Sunday came at last, and proved one of the loveliest mornings of
that delightful season of spring and sunshine. The lark carolled
high in <a name="the" id="the"></a><ins title="the not in original">the</ins> air, the swallows darted on light wings to and fro;
and the sea, vast and beautiful, gently heaved and undulated
against the shore, with scarcely a ripple to break the long line
of golden light, which danced and sparkled on its breast. The
church bells were chiming for morning prayer; and the cliffs were
covered with happy groups in their holiday attire. Flora,
surrounded by friends and relatives, strove to be cheerful; and
the day was so promising, that it infused new life and spirit into
her breast. All eyes were turned to that part of the horizon, on
which the long, black trailing smoke of the steamer was first
expected to appear. A small boat, which had been engaged to put
them and their luggage on board, and which contained all their
worldly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> chattels, lay rocking in the surf, and all was ready for
a start.</p>

<p>In the midst of an animated discussion on their future prospects,
the signal was given, that the steamer was in sight, and had
already rounded the point. How audibly to herself did Flora&#8217;s
heart beat, as a small, black speck in the distance gradually
increased to a black cloud; and not a doubt remained, that this
was the expected vessel.</p>

<p>Then came the blinding tears, the re-enactment of the last
passionate adieus, and they were once more afloat upon the water.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>THE FOG.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> human heart is made of elastic stuff; and can scarcely
experience on the same subject an equal intensity of grief.
Repetition had softened the anguish of this second parting; the
bitterness of grief was already past; and the sun of hope was
calmly rising above the clouds of sorrow, which had hung for the
last weary days so loweringly above our emigrants. Mr. Hawke and
his son alone accompanied them on this second expedition. Adam
Mansel had had enough of the sea, during their late adventure, and
thought it most prudent to make his adieus on shore.</p>

<p>James Hawke was in high spirits; anticipating with boyish
enthusiasm, the adventures which might fall to his share during a
long voyage; and his sojourn in that distant land, which was to
prove to him a very land of Goshen. Many gay hopes smiled upon
him, which, like that bright sunny day, were doomed to have a
gloomy ending, although at the beginning it promised so fair.</p>

<p>The owner of the boat, a morose old seaman, grumbled out his
commands to the two sailors who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> managed the craft, in such a
dogged, sulky tone, that it attracted the attention of the elder
Hawke, and being naturally fond of fun, he endeavoured to draw him
out. An abrupt monosyllable was the sole reply he could obtain to
any one of his many questions.</p>

<p>Lyndsay was highly amused by his surly humour, and flattered
himself that <em>he</em> might prove more successful than his friend, by
startling the sea-bear into a more lengthy growl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend,&#8221; said he carelessly, &#8220;I have forgotten your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam Rogers,&#8221; was the brief reply; uttered in a short grunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the boat belong to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks as if she had seen hard service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; both of us are the worse for wear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ice once broken, Mr. Hawke chimed in&#8212;&#8220;Have you a wife,
Captain Rogers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in the churchyard,&#8221; with a decided growl.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better for Mrs. Rogers,&#8221; whispered Lyndsay to Flora.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better let the animal alone,&#8221; said Flora in the same
tone: &#8220;&#8217;Tis sworn to silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any family, Captain Rogers?&#8221; recommenced the
incorrigible Hawke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay; more than&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls, or boys?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s that to you? Too many of both. Why do you call me Captain?
You knows well enough that I&#8217;m not a captain; never was a captain,
and never wants to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this rebuff, the surly Rogers was left to smoke his short
black pipe in peace, and in a few minutes the little boat came
alongside the huge Leviathan of the deep. A rope was thrown from
her deck, which having been secured, the following brief dialogue
ensued:</p>

<p>&#8220;The <em>City of Edinburgh</em>, for Edinburgh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <em>Queen of Scotland</em>, for Aberdeen, Captain Fraser.&#8221;</p>

<p>This announcement was followed by a look of blank astonishment and
disappointment from the party in the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the <em>City of Edinburgh</em>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We left her in the river. You had better take a passage with us
to Aberdeen,&#8221; said Captain Fraser, advancing to the side of his
vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred miles out of my way,&#8221; said Lyndsay. &#8220;Fall off.&#8221; The
tow rope was cast loose, and the floating castle resumed her
thundering course, leaving the party in the boat greatly
disconcerted by the misadventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <em>City of Edinburgh</em> must soon be here?&#8221; said Lyndsay,
addressing himself once more to Sam Rogers. That sociable
individual continued smoking his short pipe without deigning to
notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> the speaker. &#8220;Had we not better lay-to, and wait for her
coming up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we should be run down by her. Do you see yon?&#8221; pointing with
his pipe, to a grey cloud that was rolling over the surface of the
sea towards them; &#8220;that&#8217;s the sea rake&#8212;in three minutes: in less
than three minutes, you will not be able to discern objects three
yards beyond your nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleasant news,&#8221; said Mr. Hawke, with rather a dolorous sigh.
&#8220;This may turn out as bad as our last scrape. Lyndsay, you are an
unlucky fellow. If you go on as you have begun, it will be some
months before you reach Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>In less time than the old man had prognosticated, the dense fog
had rapidly spread itself over the water, blotting the sun from
the heavens, and enfolding every object in its chilly embrace. The
shores faded from their view, the very ocean on which they
floated, was heard, but no longer seen. Nature seemed to have lost
her identity, covered with that white sheet, which enveloped her
like a shroud. Flora strove in vain to pierce the thick misty
curtain by which they were surrounded. Her whole world was now
confined to the little boat and the persons it contained: the rest
of creation had become a blank. The fog wetted like rain, and was
more penetrating, and the constant efforts she made to see through
it, made her eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> and head ache, and cast a damp upon her spirits
which almost amounted to despondency.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is to be done?&#8221; asked Lyndsay, who shared the same feelings
in common with his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, that I know of,&#8221; responded Sam Rogers, &#8220;but to return.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke a dark shadow loomed through the fog, which proved to
be a small trading vessel, bound from London to Yarmouth. The
sailors hailed her, and with some difficulty ran the boat
alongside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you passed the <em>City of Edinburgh</em>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We spake her in the river. She ran foul of the <em>Courier</em> steamer,
and unshipped her rudder. She put back for repairs, and won&#8217;t be
down till to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221; muttered Sam Rogers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreeable tidings for us,&#8221; sighed Flora. &#8220;This is worse than the
storm; it is so unexpected. I should be quite disheartened, did I
not believe that Providence directed these untoward events.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to be of your opinion, Flora,&#8221; said Lyndsay, &#8220;in
spite of my disbelief in signs and omens. There is something
beyond mere accident in this second disappointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not a solemn warning to us, not to leave England?&#8221; said
Flora.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was certain that would be your interpretation of the matter,&#8221;
returned her husband; &#8220;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> having put my hand to the plough,
Flora, I will not turn back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailors now took to their oars, the dead calm precluding the
use of the sail, and began to steer their course homewards. The
fog was so dense and bewildering that they made little way, and
the long day was spent in wandering to and fro without being able
to ascertain where they were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; cried one of the men, laying his ear to the side of the
boat, &#8220;I hear the flippers of the steamer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the roar of the accursed <em>Barnet</em>,&#8221; cried the other. &#8220;I
know its voice of old, having twice been wrecked upon the reef&#8212;we
must change our course; we are on a wrong tack altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was near midnight before a breeze sprang up and dispelled the
ominous fog. The moon showed her wan face through the driving
scud, the sail was at last hoisted, and cold and hungry, and sick
at heart, our voyagers once more returned to their old port.</p>

<p>This time, however, the beach was silent and deserted. No friendly
voice welcomed them back. Old Kitson looked cross at being roused
out of his bed at one o&#8217;clock in the morning, to admit them into
the house, muttering as he did so, something about &#8220;unlucky folks,
and the deal of trouble they gave; that they had better give up
going to Canada altogether, and hire their old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> lodgings again;
that it was no joke, having his rest broken at his time of life;
that he could not afford to keep open house at all hours, for
people who were in no ways related to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With such consoling expressions of sympathy in their forlorn
condition, did the hard, worldly old man proceed to unlock the
door of their former domicile; but food, lights, and firing, he
would not produce, until Lyndsay had promised ample remuneration
for the same.</p>

<p>Exhausted in mind and body, for she had not broken her fast since
eight o&#8217;clock that morning, Flora for a long time refused to
partake of the warm cup of tea her loving partner had made with
his own hands for her especial benefit; and her tears continued to
fall involuntarily over the sleeping babe which lay upon her lap.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawke saw that her nerves were completely unstrung by fatigue,
and ran across the green, and called up Flora&#8217;s nurse to take
charge of the infant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke, kind creature that she was, instantly hurried to the
house to do what she could for the mother and child. Little Josey
was soon well warmed and fed, and Flora smiled through her tears,
when her husband made his appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Flora,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you are ill for the want of food,&#8212;I am
going to make some sandwiches for you, and you must be a good girl
and eat them, or I will never cater for you again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>Mr. Hawke exerted all his powers of drollery to enliven the
miscellaneous meal, and Flora soon retired to rest, fully
determined to bear the crosses of life with more fortitude for the
future.</p>

<p>The sun was not above the horizon, when she was roused, however,
from a deep sleep, by the stentorian voice of old Kitson, who,
anxious to get rid of his troublesome visitors, cried out, with
great glee,&#8212;&#8220;Hallo! I say&#8212;here is the right steamer at
last.&#8212;Better late than never. The red flag is hoisted at her
stern; and she is standing right in for the bay. Quick! Quick,
<em>Leaftenant</em> Lyndsay! or you&#8217;ll be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>With all possible despatch Flora dressed herself, though baffled
by anxiety from exerting unusual celerity. The business of the
toilet had to be performed in such a brief space, that it was
impossible to attend to it with any nicety. At last all was
completed; Flora hurried down to the beach, with Hannah and Mrs.
Clarke, James Hawke and Lyndsay having preceded them to arrange
their passage to the steamer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make haste, Mrs. Lyndsay,&#8221; shouted old Kitson; &#8220;these big dons
wait for no one. I have got all your trunks stowed away into the
boat, and the lads are waiting. If you miss your passage the third
time, you may give it up as a bad job.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes Flora was seated in the boat, uncheered by any
parting blessing but the cold farewell, and for ever, of old
Captain Kitson, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> could scarcely conceal the joy he felt at
their departure. The morning was wet and misty, and altogether
comfortless, and Flora was glad when the bustle of getting on
board the steamer was over, and they were safe upon her deck.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>THE STEAMBOAT.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of the early hour, and the disagreeable weather, a number
of persons, glad to escape from the close confinement of the
cabins, were pacing the deck of the steamer. Others were leaning
over the bulwarks, regarding the aspect of the country they were
rapidly passing; while some were talking in small groups, in a
loud declamatory tone, evidently more intent on attracting the
attention of the bystanders than of edifying their own immediate
listeners. Though bright eyes might look heavy, and fair faces
languid and sleepy, vanity was wide awake, and never more active
than in the midst of a crowd, where all are strangers to each
other. It affords such a glorious opportunity for display for
pretenders to rank and importance to show off their affected airs
of wealth and consequence; and the world can lay bare its rotten
heart, without much fear of detection, or dread of unpleasant
results.</p>

<p>Flora sat down upon a bench beside her husband, and her eye ranged
from group to group of those strange faces, with a mechanical,
uninterested gaze.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> Here a pretty insipid-looking girl sauntered
the deck with a book in her hand, from which she never read; and
another, more vivacious, and equally intent on attracting her
share of public notice, raved to an elderly gentleman, on whose
arm she was leaning, of the beauty and magnificence of the ocean.</p>

<p>The young and good-looking of either sex were flirting. The more
wily and experienced coquetting after a graver fashion; while the
middle-aged were gossiping to some congenial spirit on the
supposed merits or demerits of their neighbours.</p>

<p>Not a few prostrate forms might be seen reclining upon shawls and
cloaks, supported by pillows, whose languid, pale faces, and
disarranged tresses, showed that the demon of the waters had been
at work, and remorselessly had stricken them down.</p>

<p>Standing near the seat occupied by the Lyndsays, Flora observed a
tall, fashionably-dressed woman, apparently about twenty-eight or
thirty years of age. She was laughing and chatting in the most
lively and familiar manner with a handsome, middle-aged man, in a
military undress. The person of the lady was very agreeable, and
though neither pretty nor elegant, was fascinating and attractive.</p>

<p>As her male companion constantly addressed her as Mrs. Dalton, we
will call her by her name. When Mrs. Lyndsay first took her seat
upon the deck Mrs. Dalton left off her conversation with Major
F&#8212;&mdash;, and regarded the new arrival with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> long, cool, deliberate
stare, which would have won a smile from Flora, had it not been
evidently meant to insult and annoy; for, turning to the Major,
with a glance of peculiar meaning, accompanied with the least
possible elevation of her shoulders, she let slip the
word&#8212;&#8220;<em>Nobody</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that <em>he</em> is a gentleman, and, if I mistake not, an
officer, and a fine intelligent looking man,&#8221; remarked her
companion, in an aside; &#8220;and I like the appearance of his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Sir, I tell you that <em>she is nobody</em>. Look at that merino
gown; what lady would venture on board these fine vessels, where
they meet with so many <em>fashionable</em> people, in such a dress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very suitable dress, I should say, for a sea voyage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; muttered Mrs. Dalton, &#8220;have done with your prudent Scotch
sense of propriety. Who minds spoiling a good dress or two, when
their standing in society is risked by appearing shabby? I tell
you, Major, that she is <em>nobody</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you not told me that you had passed the greater part of your
life, Mrs. Dalton, in a British Colony, I could have sworn to the
fact, from your last speech,&#8221; said her companion: &#8220;you all think
so much of dress, that with you it is really the coat which makes
the man, and, I suppose, the gown which makes the lady. However,
you shall have it your own way. You know how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> easy it is for you
to bring me over to your opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that a pretty woman?&#8221; she said, directing her
husband&#8217;s eyes towards the lady in question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; he replied coldly, &#8220;but very worldly and sophisticated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear you say so,&#8221; said Flora, like a true woman;
&#8220;that is precisely the opinion I have formed of her. Is that
officer her husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should rather think not. Husbands and wives seldom try to
attract public attention to themselves, as that man and woman are
doing. I have no doubt they are strangers who never met before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing more probable; people who meet on short journeys and
voyages like this, often throw aside the restraints imposed by
society, and act and talk in a manner which would be severely
censured in circles where they are known. Were you never favoured
by the autobiography of a fellow-traveller in a stage-coach?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes often, and thought it very odd that any one should reveal so
much of their private history to a stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a common occurrence, originating in the vanity of persons
who love to make themselves and their affairs the subject of
conversation; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> if they can but obtain listeners, never stop to
question who or what they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I remember getting into a sad scrape,&#8221; said Flora, &#8220;while
travelling from S&#8212;&mdash; to London in a stage-coach. It was one of
these uncomfortable things which one hates to think of for the
rest of a life, and yet so ridiculous that one feels more inclined
to laugh over it than to cry, though I believe (for I was but a
girl at the time), I did both.</p>

<p>&#8220;My fellow-passengers were three gentlemen, one, to whom I was
well known, the others perfect strangers. One of the latter, a
very well-dressed but rather foppish, conceited young man, talked
much upon literary matters, and from his conversation gave you to
understand that he was on the most intimate terms with all the
celebrated authors of the day. After giving us a very frank, and
by no means just critique upon the works of Scott and Byron, whom
he familiarly called, &#8216;my friend, Sir Walter,&#8217; &#8216;my companion,
Lord Byron,&#8217; he suddenly turned to me, and asked me, &#8216;if I ever
read the S. Chronicle?&#8217; This was one of the county papers, I told
him; that I saw it every week.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If that be the case,&#8217; said he, &#8216;will you tell me what you
think of the Rev. Mr. B.&#8217;s poems, which have from time to time
appeared in its columns?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This reverend gentleman was a man with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> very heavy purse and a
very empty head, whose contributions to the county papers were
never read but to be laughed at. Not having the slightest personal
knowledge of the author, I answered innocently enough, &#8216;Oh, he&#8217;s
a stupid, conceited fellow. It is a pity he has not some friend to
tell him what a fool he makes of himself, whenever he appears in
print. His poetry is such dull trash, that I am certain he must
pay the Editor of the paper for allowing him to put it in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. C. was stuffing his handkerchief into his mouth, to avoid
laughing out right; while the poor gentleman (for it was the
author himself), drew back with a face alternately red and pale,
with suppressed indignation. His feelings must have been dreadful,
for, during the rest of his <a name="comma2" id="comma2"></a><ins title="comma in original">journey,</ins> he sat and regarded me with
an air of such offended dignity, that I must have appeared to him
like some wicked ogress, ready to devour, at one mouthful, him and
his literary fame. He never opened his mouth to speak to any of us
after I had made this unfortunate blunder, and I sat upon thorns,
until a handsome plain carriage drove up to the coach about a mile
from T., and relieved us of his company.</p>

<p>&#8220;This circumstance made me feel so uncomfortable, that I never
ventured upon giving an opinion of the works of any living author
to a stranger, without having a previous knowledge of the person
of the writer.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>&#8220;He deserved what he got, for his egregious vanity,&#8221; said Lyndsay.
&#8220;For my part, I do not pity him at all; and it afforded you a good
lesson of prudence for the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a young negro lad, fantastically dressed, and
evidently very much in love with himself, strutted past. As he
swaggered along the deck, rolling his jet black eyes from side to
side, and showing his white teeth to the spectators, an
indolent-looking young man, dressed in the extreme of fashion,
called languidly after him&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hollo, Blacky! What colour&#8217;s the Devil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;White,&#8221; responded the negro, &#8220;and sports red whiskers, like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one laughed; the dandy shrunk back, utterly confounded;
while the negro snapped his fingers, and crowed with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hector, go down into the ladies&#8217; cabin, and wait there until I
call for you,&#8221; cried Mrs. Dalton, in an angry voice; &#8220;I did not
bring you here to insult gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De Buckra affront me first!&#8221; returned the sable page, as he
sullenly withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;That boy grows very pert,&#8221; continued his mistress, turning to
Major F.; &#8220;this is the consequence of the ridiculous stir made by
the English people against slavery. The fellow knows that he is
free the moment that he touches the British shores; and he thinks
that he can show his independence by disobeying my commands, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
being insolent to his superiors. I hope he will not take it into
his head to leave me, for he saves me all the trouble of taking
care of the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major laughed, while Flora pitied the children, and wondered
how any mother could confide them to the care of such a nurse.</p>

<p>The clouds, which had been rising for some time, now gave very
unequivocal notice of an approaching storm. The rain began to
fall, and the decks were quickly cleared of their motley groups.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>A PEEP INTO THE LADIES&#8217; CABIN.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">In</span> the ladies&#8217; cabin all was helplessness and confusion: the
larger portion of the berths were already occupied by invalids in
every stage of sea-sickness; the floor and sofas were strewn with
bonnets and shawls, and articles of dress were scattered about in
all directions. Some of the ladies were stretched upon the carpet;
others, in a sitting posture, were supporting their aching heads
upon their knees, and appeared perfectly indifferent to all that
was passing around them, and only alive to their own misery.
Others there were, who, beginning to recover from the odious
malady, were employing their returning faculties in quizzing, and
making remarks in audible whispers, on their prostrate companions.</p>

<p>The centre of such a group was a little sharp-faced, dark-eyed,
sallow-skinned old maid of forty, whose angular figure was covered
with ample folds of rich black silk, cut very low in the bust, and
exposing a portion of her person, which, in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> ladies of her
age, is better hid. She was travelling companion to a large,
showily-dressed matron of fifty, who occupied the best sofa in the
cabin, and, although evidently convalescent, commanded the
principal attendance of the stewardess, while she graciously
received the gratuitous services of all who were well enough to
render her their homage. She was evidently the great lady of the
cabin; and round her couch a knot of gossips had collected, when
Flora, followed by Hannah carrying the baby, entered upon the
scene.</p>

<p>The character of Mrs. Dalton formed the topic of conversation. The
little old maid was remorselessly tearing it to tatters. &#8220;No woman
who valued her reputation,&#8221; she said, with pious horror in her
looks and tone, &#8220;would flirt in the disgraceful manner that Mrs.
Dalton was doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some excuse for her conduct,&#8221; remarked a plain but
interesting-looking woman, not herself in the early spring of
life. &#8220;Mrs. Dalton is a West Indian, and has not been brought up
with our ideas of refinement and delicacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider it no excuse,&#8221; cried the other vehemently, glancing
up, as the cabin-door opened to admit Flora and her maid, to be
sure that the object of her animadversions was not within earshot.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me. She knows, Miss Leigh, very well what she&#8217;s about.
Is it no crime, think you, to endeavour to attract the attention
of Major F.? My dear Madam,&#8221; turning to the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> lady, who with
her head languidly propped by her hand, was eagerly listening to a
conversation which so nearly concerned her: &#8220;I wonder you can bear
so calmly her flirtations with your husband. If it were me now, I
should be ready to tear her eyes out. Do speak to the creature,
and remonstrate with her on her scandalous conduct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear Miss Mann, I am used to these things,&#8221; sighed Mrs. F.
&#8220;No conduct of the Major&#8217;s can give me the least uneasiness now.
Nor do I think, that Mrs. Dalton is aware that she is trying to
seduce the affections of a <em>married</em> man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That she is though,&#8221; exclaimed Miss Mann, triumphantly. &#8220;I took
care to interrupt one of their lively conversations, by telling
Major F. that his wife was ill, and wished to see him. Mrs. Dalton
coloured, and moved away; but the moment my back was turned, she
recommenced her attack. If she were a widow, one might make some
allowance for her. But a young married woman, with two small
children! I have no doubt that she left her husband for no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was married very young, to a man more than double her own
age,&#8221; said Miss Leigh. &#8220;The match was made for her by her
friends&#8212;especially by her grandmother, who now resides in
Edinburgh, and whom I know very well; a woman of considerable
property, by whom Mrs. Dalton was brought up. She was always a
gay, flighty girl, dreadfully indulged, and used from a child to
have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> her own way. I consider her lot peculiarly hard, in being
united, when a mere girl, to a man whom she had scarcely seen a
dozen times, and whom she did not love. The worst that can be said
of her is, that she is vain and imprudent; but I can never believe
that she is the bad, designing woman you would make her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her conduct is very creditable for a clergyman&#8217;s wife,&#8221; sneered
the old maid. &#8220;I wonder the rain don&#8217;t bring her down into the
cabin. But the society of ladies would prove very insipid to a
person of her peculiar taste. I should like to know what brings
her from Jamaica?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it will satisfy your doubts, I can inform you,&#8221; said Miss
Leigh, with a quiet smile. &#8220;To place her two children with her
grandmother, that they may receive an European education. She is a
thoughtless being, but hardly deserves your severe censures.&#8221;</p>

<p>The amiable manner in which this lady endeavoured to defend the
absent, without wholly excusing her levity, struck Flora very
forcibly. Mrs. Dalton&#8217;s conduct upon deck had created in her own
mind no very favourable opinion of her good qualities. Miss
Leigh&#8217;s remarks tended not a little to soften her disgust and
aversion towards that individual, whose attack upon her she felt
was as ill-natured, as it was unjust. She was now inclined to let
them pass for what they were worth, and to dismiss Mrs. Dalton
from her thoughts altogether.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> But Miss Mann was too much excited
by Miss Leigh&#8217;s extenuating remarks, to let the subject drop, and
returned with fresh vigour to the charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is totally beyond my power,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;to do justice to her
vanity and frivolity. No one ever before accused me of being
ill-natured, or censorious; but that woman is the vainest person I
ever saw. Did you notice, my dear Mrs. F., that she changed her
dress three times yesterday, and twice to-day? She knelt a whole
hour before the cheval-glass, arranging her hair, and trying on a
variety of expensive head-dresses, before she could fix on one for
the saloon. I should be ashamed of being the only lady among so
many men. But she is past blushing&#8212;she has a face of brass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so plain too,&#8221; murmured Mrs. Major F.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot deny that her features are good, ladies,&#8221; again
interposed Miss Leigh; &#8220;but creoles seldom possess the fine red
and white of our British belles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At night,&#8221; suggested Miss Mann, &#8220;her colour is remarkably good:
it is not subject to any variation like ours. The bleak sea air
does not dim the roses on her cheeks; while these young ladies
look as blue and as cold as figures carved out of stone. Of
course, Miss Leigh will think me very uncharitable in saying that
Mrs. D. paints; but I know she does. She left her dressing-case
open yesterday, and her little boy was dabbling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> his fingers in
her French carmine and pearl white, and a fine mess he made of his
mamma&#8217;s beautiful complexion. Bless me!&#8221; exclaimed the old maid,
suddenly lowering her voice to a whisper, &#8220;if there is not her
black imp sitting under the table; he will be sure to tell her all
that we have said about her! What a nuisance he is! I do not think
it is proper for him, a great boy of sixteen, to be admitted into
the ladies&#8217; cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; said Mrs. Major F.; &#8220;nobody cares for him&#8212;a black.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear Mrs. F., though he is a black, the boy has eyes and
ears, like the rest of his sex, and my sense of female propriety
is shocked by his presence. But, who are these people?&#8221;&#8212;glancing
at Flora and her maid&#8212;&#8220;and why is that woman admitted into the
ladies&#8217; cabin?&#8212;servants have no business here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is the nurse; that alters the case,&#8221; said Miss Leigh. &#8220;The
plea of being the children&#8217;s attendant brought Master Hector into
the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy is black, and has, on that score, as Mrs. Major F. says,
neither rank nor sex,&#8221; continued the waspish Miss Mann,
contradicting the objections she had made to Hector&#8217;s company only
a few minutes before. &#8220;I will not submit to this insult, nor
occupy the same apartment with a servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Madam, you strangely forget yourself,&#8221; said Miss Leigh.
&#8220;This lady has a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> young infant, and cannot do without the aid
of her nurse. A decent, tidy young woman is not quite such a
nuisance as the noisy black boy that Mrs. Dalton has entailed upon
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, then she is a woman of <em>fashion</em>,&#8221; whispered Miss Mann; &#8220;and
we know nothing about these people, and if I were to judge by the
young person&#8217;s dress&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very poor criterion,&#8221; interrupted Miss Leigh; &#8220;I draw my
inferences from a higher source.&#8221; And turning to Flora, she
inquired, in a kind, friendly tone, &#8220;if she were going all the way
to Edinburgh, the age of the baby, and how both were affected by
the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Flora could answer these questions, Miss Mann addressed her
with great asperity of look and manner&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, Madam, you are not aware that it is against the
regulations of these vessels, to admit servants into the state
cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, ladies,&#8221; said Flora, rather proudly, &#8220;that the
presence of mine should incommode you. I have only just recovered
from a dangerous illness, and am unable at present to take the
whole charge of the child myself. I have paid for my servant&#8217;s
attendance upon me in the cabin, and I am certain that she will
conduct herself in a manner not to offend the prejudices of any
one here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How unpleasant,&#8221; grumbled the old maid, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> she turned
disdainfully on her heel; &#8220;but what else can be expected from
under-bred people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send away your nurse,&#8221; said Miss Leigh, in a low voice, to Mrs.
Lyndsay; &#8220;her presence gives, it seems, great offence to certain
people, and, if I may judge by her pale looks, she will be of
little service to you; I will help you to take care of your sweet
baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora immediately complied with Miss Leigh&#8217;s request. Hannah was
dismissed, and, indeed, the poor girl had enough to do to take
care of herself.</p>

<p>Towards evening the wind rose to a gale, and Flora, who had not
suffered from sickness during her two disastrous trips to sea,
became so alarmingly ill, that she was unable to attend to the
infant, or assist herself. Miss Leigh, like a good Samaritan, sat
up with her during the night, but in the morning she was so much
worse, that she earnestly requested that her husband might be
allowed to see her.</p>

<p>Her petition was warmly seconded by Miss Leigh, but met with a
decided refusal from the rest of the lady-passengers. Mrs. Dalton,
who took a very prominent part in the matter, sprang from her
berth, and, putting her back against the cabin door, declared,
&#8220;That no man save the surgeon should gain, with her consent, an
entrance there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I hope, Madam,&#8221; said Miss Leigh, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> was supporting Flora
in her arms, &#8220;that you will adhere to your own regulations, and
dismiss your black boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do no such thing; my objection is to men, and not to
boys.&#8212;Hector, remain where you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How consistent!&#8221; sneered the old maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor lady may die,&#8221; suggested Miss Leigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send for the Doctor&#8212;there is one on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Doctor, ladies,&#8221; said the stewardess, coming forward, &#8220;got
hurt last night by the fall of the sail, during the storm, and is
ill in his bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If such is the case,&#8221; continued Miss Leigh, &#8220;you cannot, surely,
deny the lady the consolation of speaking to her husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a noise that squalling child makes!&#8221; cried a fat woman,
popping her night-capped head out of an upper berth; &#8220;can&#8217;t it be
removed? It hinders me from getting a wink of sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot you take charge of it, Stewardess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, La! I&#8217;ve too much upon my hands already&#8212;what with Mrs.
Dalton&#8217;s children and all this sickness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a little mercy, ladies, on the sick mother, and I will
endeavour to pacify its cries,&#8221; said Miss Leigh. &#8220;Poor little
thing, it misses her care, and we are all strange to it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>&#8220;I insist upon its being removed!&#8221; cried the fat woman. &#8220;The
comfort of every lady in the cabin is not to be sacrificed for the
sake of that squalling brat. If women choose to travel with such
young infants, they should take a private conveyance. I will
complain to the Captain, if the stewardess does not remove it
instantly.&#8221;</p>

<p>What a difference there is in women! Some, like ministering
angels, strew flowers and scatter blessings along the rugged paths
of life; while others, by their malevolence and pride, increase
its sorrows an hundred fold.</p>

<p>The next day continued stormy, and the rain fell in torrents. The
unsteady motion of the ship did not tend to improve the health of
the occupants of the ladies&#8217; cabin. Those who had been well the
day before, were now as helpless and miserable as their
companions. Miss Leigh alone seemed to retain her usual composure.
Mrs. Dalton could scarcely be named in this catalogue, as she only
slept and dressed in the cabin, the rest of her time being devoted
to her friends upon deck, but, in spite of the boisterous winds
and heavy sea, she was as gay and as airy as ever.</p>

<p>Her noisy children were confined to the cabin, where they amused
themselves by running races round the table, and shouting at the
top of their shrill voices. In all their pranks, they were
encouraged and abetted by Hector, who, regardless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> of the
entreaties of the invalids, and the maledictions of the
exasperated stewardess, did his very best to increase the uproar
and confusion. Hector did not care for the commands of any one but
his mistress, and she was in the saloon, playing at billiards with
Major F.</p>

<p>Little Willie Dalton had discovered the baby, and Flora was
terrified whenever he approached her berth, which was on a level
with the floor of the cabin, as that young gentleman, who was at
the unmanageable age of three years, seemed decidedly bent on
mischief. Twice he had crept into her bed on his hands and knees,
and aimed a blow at the head of the sleeping babe with the leg of
a broken chair, which he had found beneath the sofa.</p>

<p>While the ladies slept, Hector stole from berth to berth, and
possessed himself of all their stores of oranges, lemons, and
cayenne lozenges; sharing the spoils with the troublesome, spoilt
monkeys, left by their careful mamma in his keeping.</p>

<p>Towards evening Mrs. Lyndsay felt greatly recovered from her
grievous attack of sea-sickness; and, with the assistance of Miss
Leigh, she contrived to dress herself, and get upon the deck.</p>

<p>The rain was still falling in large, heavy drops; but the sun was
bravely struggling through the dense masses of black clouds, which
had obscured his rays during the long stormy day, and now cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> a
watery and uncertain gleam upon the wild scenery, over which
Bamborough Castle frowns in savage sublimity.</p>

<p>This was the last glance Flora gave to the shores of dear old
England. The angry, turbulent ocean, the lowering sky, and falling
rain, seemed emblems of her own sad destiny. Her head sunk upon
her husband&#8217;s shoulder, as he silently clasped her to his breast;
and she could only answer his anxious inquiries respecting herself
and the child with heavy sobs. For his sake&#8212;for the sake of the
little one, who was nestled closely to her throbbing heart&#8212;she
had consented to leave those shores for ever. Then why did she
repine? Why did that last glance of her native land fill her heart
with such unutterable grief? Visions of the dim future floated
before her, prophetic of all the trials and sorrows which awaited
her in those unknown regions to which they were journeying. She
had obeyed the call of duty, but had not yet tasted the reward.
The sacrifice had not been as yet purified and sublimed, by
long-suffering and self-denial, so as to render it an acceptable
offering on so holy a shrine. She looked up to heaven, and tried
to breathe a prayer; but all was still and dark in her bewildered
mind.</p>

<p>The kind voice of her husband at last roused her from the
indulgence of vain regrets. The night was raw and cold; the decks
wet and slippery from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> the increasing rain; and, with an
affectionate pressure of the hand that went far to reconcile her
to her lot, Lyndsay whispered, &#8220;This is no place for you, Flora,
and my child. Return, dearest, to the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>With reluctance Flora obeyed. Beside him she felt neither the cold
nor wet; and, with the greatest repugnance, she re-entered the
ladies&#8217; cabin, and, retiring to her berth, enjoyed for several
hours a tranquil and refreshing sleep.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>MRS. DALTON.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">It</span> was midnight when Mrs. Lyndsay awoke. A profound stillness
reigned in the cabin; the invalids had forgotten their sufferings
in sleep,&#8212;all but one female figure, who was seated upon the
carpeted floor, just in front of Flora&#8217;s berth, wrapped in a loose
dressing-gown, and engaged in reading a letter. Flora instantly
recognised in the watcher the tall, graceful figure of Mrs.
Dalton.</p>

<p>Her mind seemed agitated by some painful recollections; and she
sighed frequently, and several tears stole slowly over her cheeks,
as she replaced the paper carefully in her bosom, and for many
minutes appeared lost in deep and earnest thought. All her
accustomed gaiety was gone; and her fine features wore a sad and
regretful expression, far more touching and interesting than the
heartless levity by which they were generally distinguished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible, that that frivolous mind can be touched by
grief?&#8221; thought Flora. &#8220;That that woman can feel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalton, as if she had heard the unuttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> query, raised her
head, and caught the intense glance with which Mrs. Lyndsay was
unconsciously regarding her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought no one was awake but myself,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I am a bad
sleeper. If you are the same, we will have a little chat together;
I am naturally a sociable animal. Of all company, I find my own
the worst, and above all things hate to be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surprised at this frank invitation, from a woman who had
pronounced her <em>nobody</em>, Flora replied, rather coldly, &#8220;I fear,
Mrs. Dalton, that our conversation would not suit each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is as much as to say, that you don&#8217;t like me; and that you
conclude from that circumstance, that I don&#8217;t like you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be candid then,&#8212;you are right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy that you overheard my observations to Major F.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well if you did, I can forgive you for disliking me. When I first
saw you, I thought you a very plain person, and judged by your
dress, that you held a very inferior rank in society. After
listening a few minutes to your conversation with Miss Leigh, who
is a highly educated woman, I felt convinced that I was wrong; and
that you were far superior to most of the women round me. Of
course you thought me a very malicious, vain woman.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>Flora smiled, in spite of herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you may speak it out. I shan&#8217;t like you a bit the less for
speaking the truth. I am a strange, wayward creature, subject at
times to the most dreadful depression of spirits; and it is only
by affecting excessive gaiety that I hinder myself from falling
into the most hopeless despondency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a state of mind is not natural to one of your age, and who
possesses so many personal attractions. There must be some cause
for these fits of gloom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there is. I am not quite the heartless coquet I seem.
My father was an officer in the army, and commanded a regiment in
the West Indies, where I was born. I was an only child, and very
much indulged by both my parents. I lost them while I was a mere
child, and was sent to Scotland to be educated by my grandmother.
I was an irritable, volatile, spoilt child, and expected that
everybody would yield to me, as readily as my slave attendants had
done in Jamaica. In this I was disappointed. My grandmother was a
proud, ambitious woman, and a strict disciplinarian; and it was a
constant battle between us who should be master. I was no match,
however, for the old lady, and I fretted constantly under her
control, longing for any chance that might free me from her rule.
It was a joyful day for me, when I was sent to finish my education
at one of the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> schools in Edinburgh, which I did not leave
until I was sixteen years of age. I found grandmamma several years
older, and many degrees more exacting than she was before. She was
so much alarmed lest I should make an unsuitable alliance, that
she never suffered me to go out without I was accompanied by
herself, or an old maiden aunt, who was more rigid and stiff than
even grandmamma herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this period of my girlhood, and before I had seen anything of
the world, or could in the least judge for myself, a very wealthy
clergyman, who had been a great friend of poor papa&#8217;s, called to
see me, before he returned to Jamaica; where he had a fine living,
and possessed a noble property. Unfortunately for me, he fell
desperately in love with the orphan daughter of his friend, and
his suit was vehemently backed by grandmamma and aunt. He was a
handsome, worthy kind man, but old enough to have been my father.
I was so unhappy and restless at home, that I was easily persuaded
to become his wife; and I, who had never been in love, thought it
was a fine thing to be married, and my own mistress at sixteen.
Our union has not been a happy one. I much question if such unions
ever are. He is now an aged man, while I am in the very bloom of
life, and consequently exposed to much temptation. Thank God! I
have never acted criminally, though often severely tried. My home
is one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> many luxuries, but it has no domestic joys. My children
are the only tie that binds me to a man I cannot love; and I have
been so long used to drown my disappointment and regret in a whirl
of dissipation, that it is only in scenes of gaiety that I forget
my grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own sex speak slightly of me; but I do not deserve their
severe censures. My fellow-passengers, I heard from Hector, made a
thousand malicious remarks about me yesterday, and that you and
Miss Leigh were the only ladies who took my part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My conduct,&#8221; replied Flora, &#8220;was perfectly negative. I said
nothing either in praise or blame. I may have injured you by
thinking hardly of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for your forbearance, in keeping your thoughts to
yourself, for I did not deserve that from you. If I did flirt a
little with Major F., it was done more to provoke the spleen of
that ill-natured old maid, who acts the part of Cerberus for his
proud, pompous wife, than for any wish to attract his attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is better,&#8221; said Flora, her heart softening towards her
companion, &#8220;to avoid all appearance of evil. Superficial observers
only judge by outward appearance, and your conduct must have
appeared strange to a jealous woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was jealous of me then?&#8221; cried the volatile Mrs. Dalton,
clapping her hands in an ecstasy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> of delight. &#8220;Oh, I am so glad
that it annoyed <a name="her" id="her"></a><ins title="no fullstop in original">her.</ins>&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora could not help laughing at the vivacity with which she
turned her words to make them subservient to her own vanity. But
when she described the consternation felt by Miss Mann, on
discovering Hector under the table, her eccentric companion
laughed until the tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p>The introduction of Hector insensibly turned the conversation upon
the state of the slaves in the West Indies. The excitement of the
slave question was just then at its height; but the bill for their
emancipation had not yet passed the Houses of Parliament. Upon
Flora expressing her abhorrence of the whole system, Mrs. Dalton
proceeded to defend it with no little warmth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I perceive that you know nothing about it. You are infected
with the bigotry and prejudices of the Anti-slavery advocates.
Negroes are an inferior race; they were made to work for civilized
men, in climates where labour would be death to those of a
different complexion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is reducing the African to a mere beast of burthen&#8212;a
machine in the form of man. The just God never made a race of
beings purposely to drag out a painful existence in perpetual toil
and degradation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are better off than your peasants at home,&#8221; continued Mrs.
Dalton, indignantly;&#8212;&#8220;better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> fed, and taken care of. As to the
idle tales they tell you about flogging, starvation, and killing
slaves, they are fearful exaggerations, not worthy of credit. Do
you think a farmer would kill a horse, that he knew was worth a
hundred pounds, out of revenge for his having done some trifling
injury to his harness? A planter would not disable a valuable
slave, if by so doing he injured himself. But your slave adorers
will not listen to reason and common sense. I have been the owner
of many slaves; but I never ill-used one of them in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hector is an example of over-indulgence,&#8221; said Flora. &#8220;But still
he is only a pet animal in your estimation. Tell me truly, Mrs.
Dalton, do you believe that a negro has a soul to be saved?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it doubtful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you the wife of a Christian minister?&#8221; said Flora,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they had immortal souls and reasoning minds, we should not be
permitted to hold them as slaves. Their degradation proves their
inferiority.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It only proves the brutalizing effects of your immoral system,&#8221;
said Flora, waxing warm. &#8220;I taught a black man from the island of
St. Vincent to read the Bible fluently in ten weeks. Was that a
proof of mental incapacity? I never met with an uneducated white
man who learned to read so rapidly, or who pursued his studies
with the ardour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> of this despised, soulless black. His motive for
this exertion was a noble one, which I believe cost him his
life&#8212;the hope of carrying the glad tidings of salvation to his
benighted countrymen, which he considered the best means of
improving their condition, and rendering less burdensome their
oppressive yoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This was all very well in theory; but it will never do in
practice. If the British Government, urged on by a set of
fanatics, who, in reality are more anxious to bring themselves
into notice, than to emancipate the slaves, madly persist in
adopting their ridiculous project, it will involve the West Indies
in ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It were better that the whole group of islands were sunk in the
depths of the sea,&#8221; said Flora, vehemently, &#8220;than continue to
present to the world a system of injustice and cruelty, which is a
disgrace to a Christian community&#8212;a spectacle of infamy to the
civilized world. And do not think that the wise and good men who
are engaged heart and hand in this holy cause, will cease their
exertions until their great object is accomplished, and slavery is
banished from the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalton stared at Flora in amazement. She could not in the
least comprehend her enthusiasm. &#8220;Who cares for a slave?&#8221; she
said, contemptuously. &#8220;You must live among them, and be conversant
with their habits before you can understand their inferiority. One
would think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> that you belonged to the Anti-Slavery Society to hear
the warmth with which you argue the case. Do you belong to that
odious society? for I understand that many pious women make
themselves vastly busy in publicly discussing the <em>black</em>
question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have many dear friends who are among its staunch supporters,
both men and women; whose motives are purely benevolent; who have
nothing to gain by the freedom of the slaves, beyond the
satisfaction of endeavouring to forward a good work, which if it
succeeds, (and we pray God that it may,) will restore a large
portion of the human family to their rights as immortal and
rational creatures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mere cant&#8212;the vanity of making a noise in the world. One of the
refined hypocrisies of the present age. By-the-bye, my dear Madam,
have you read a tract published lately by this disinterested
society, called the History of Mary P.? It is set forth to be an
authentic narrative, while I know enough of the West Indies, to
pronounce it a tissue of falsehoods from beginning to end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know Mary P.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who does. It is an imaginary tale got up for party
purposes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken,&#8221; said Flora quietly. &#8220;That narrative is
strictly true. I was staying the winter before last, with her
mistress in London, and I wrote it myself from the woman&#8217;s own
lips.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>&#8220;You!&#8221; and Mrs. Dalton started from the ground as though she had
been bitten by a serpent&#8212;&#8220;and I have been talking all this time
to the author of Mary P. From this moment, Madam, we must regard
ourselves as strangers. No West Indian could for a moment tolerate
the writer of that odious pamphlet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalton retired to her berth, which was in the state cabin;
and Flora lay awake for several hours, pondering over their
conversation, until the morning broke, and the steamer cast anchor
off Newhaven.</p>

<small>EDINBURGH.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> storm had passed away during the night; and at day-break,
Flora hurried upon deck, to catch the first glance of&#8212;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">&#8220;The glorious land of flood and fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noble north countrie.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">The sun was still below the horizon, and a thick mist hung
over the waters, and hid the city from her view. Oh, for the
rising of that white curtain! how Flora tried to peer through its
vapoury folds, to</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">&#8220;Hail old Scotia&#8217;s darling seat,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">the beautiful abode of brave, intelligent, true-hearted
men, and fair good women. Glorious Edinburgh! who ever beheld you
for the first time with indifference, and felt not his eyes
brighten, and his heart thrill with a proud ecstasy, the mingling
of his spirit with a scene, which in romantic sublimity, has not
its equal in the wide world&#8212;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">&#8220;Who would not dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fight for such a land!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>exclaims the patriotic wizard of the North. Ay, and to die
for it, if need be, as every true-hearted Scot would die, rather
than see one stain cast upon the national glory of his noble
country. The character of a people is greatly influenced by the
local features of the land to which it belongs; and the
inhabitants of mountainous districts have ever evaded most
effectually the encroachments of foreign invaders. The Scot may,
perhaps, derive from his romantic country, much of that poetic
temperament, that stern, uncompromising love of independence,
which has placed him in the first rank as a man.</p>

<p>The sun at length rose; the fog rolled its grey masses upwards,
and the glorious old castle emerged from between the parting
clouds, like some fabled palace of the gods, its antique towers
glittering like gold in the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how beautiful!&#8221; exclaimed Flora, her eye kindling, and her
cheek flushing with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;The situation of Quebec is almost as fine,&#8221; said Captain Forbes,
who had been watching with pleasure the effect which the first
sight of his native city produced upon her countenance. &#8220;It will
lose little by comparison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; cried Flora, eagerly turning to the speaker, &#8220;I had
formed no idea of anything in Canada being at all equal to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been there, Captain?&#8221; said Lyndsay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, many times; and always with increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> pleasure. Quebec
combines every object which is requisite to make a scene truly
magnificent&#8212;woods, mountains, rivers, cataracts; and all on the
most stupendous scale. A lover of nature cannot fail to be
delighted with the rock-defended fortress of British North
America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made me quite happy, Captain Forbes,&#8221; said Flora; &#8220;I
have contemplated a residence in Canada with feelings of such
antipathy, that your description of Quebec almost reconciles me to
my lot. I can never hate a country which abounds in natural
beauty.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Boats were now constantly plying to and from the shore, conveying
passengers and their luggage from the ship to the pier. The
Captain, who had recognised a countryman in Lyndsay, insisted on
the voyagers taking breakfast with him before they left the
vessel. Mrs. Lyndsay accepted the offer with such hearty
good-will, that the Captain laughed and rubbed his hands in the
excess of hospitable satisfaction, as he called to his steward to
place a small table under an awning upon the deck, and serve the
breakfast there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will enjoy it much more in the fresh air, Mrs. Lyndsay,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;after your severe illness, than in the close air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was delighted with the arrangement, and set the Captain down
as a man of taste, as by this means he had provided for her a
double feast&#8212;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> beautiful scenery which on every side met her
gaze, and an excellent breakfast, served in the balmy morning air.</p>

<p>The rugged grace with which the gallant tar presided at what might
be termed his own private table, infused a cheerful spirit into
those around him, and never was a meal more heartily enjoyed by
our emigrants. James Hawke, who had been confined during the whole
voyage to his berth, now rejoined his friends, and ate of the
savoury things before him in such downright earnest, that the
Captain declared that it was a pleasure to watch the lad handle
his knife and fork.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a fellow has been starving for eight and forty hours, it is
not a trifle that can satisfy his hunger,&#8221; said Jim, making a
vigorous onslaught upon a leg of Scotch mutton. &#8220;Oh! I never was
so hungry in my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even during those two disastrous days last week, which we
spent starving at sea,&#8221; said Flora.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, don&#8217;t name them,&#8221; said the boy, with an air of intense
disgust. &#8220;Those days were attended with such <em>qualms</em> of
conscience that I have banished them from the log of life
altogether. Oh, those dreadful days!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Jim, you make a worse sailor than I expected,&#8221; said Flora;
&#8220;how shall we get you alive to Canada?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never fear,&#8221; said the lad, gaily; &#8220;I have cast all those
horrible reminiscences into the sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> I was very ill, but &#8217;tis all
over now, and I feel as light as a feather; you will see that I
shall be quite myself again, directly we lose sight of the British
shores.&#8221;</p>

<p>On returning to the ladies&#8217; cabin, to point out her luggage to the
steward of the boat, Flora found that important functionary,
pacing to and fro the now empty scene of all her trouble in high
disdain. She had paid very little attention to Mrs. Lyndsay during
the voyage. She had waited with the most obsequious politeness on
Mrs. Major F. and Mrs. Dalton, because she fancied they were rich
people, who would amply reward her for her services. They had
given her all the trouble they possibly could, while she had
received few commands from Flora, and those few she had neglected
to perform. Still, as Flora well knew that the paid salary of
these people is small, and that they mainly depend upon the
trifles bestowed upon them by passengers, she slipped half-a-crown
into her hand, and begged her to see that the trunks she had
pointed out were carried upon deck.</p>

<p>The woman stared at her, and dropped a low curtsey.</p>

<p>&#8220;La, Mem, you are one of the very few of our passengers who has
been kind enough to remember the stewardess. It&#8217;s too bad&#8212;indeed
it is. And all the trouble that that Mrs. Dalton gave with her
spoilt children, and nasty black vagabond. And would you believe
me, she went off without bestowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> on me a single penny! And
worse than that, I heard her tell the big fat woman, that never
rose up in her berth, but to drink brandy-and-water, &#8216;That it was
a bad fashion the Hinglish had of paying servants, and the sooner
it was got rid of the better.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I perfectly hagrees with you,&#8217; said the fat woman; and so she
gave nothing;&#8212;no&#8212;not even thanks. Mrs. Major F&#8212;&mdash; pretended not
to see me, though I am sure I&#8217;m no midge; and I stood in the
doorway on purpose to give her a hint; but the hideous little old
maid told me to get out of the way, as she wanted to go upon deck
to speak to the Major. Oh, the meanness of these would-be fine
ladies! But if ever they come to Scotland in this boat
again&#8212;won&#8217;t I pay them off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora enjoyed these unsolicited confessions of a disappointed
stewardess; and she was forced to turn away her head for fear of
betraying a wicked inclination to laugh, which if indulged in at
that moment would, I have no doubt, have afforded her great
satisfaction and delight. As it was, she made no comment upon the
meanness of her fellow-passengers, nor consoled the excited
stewardess by complaining of their unlady-like conduct to
herself.&#8212;What they were in their rank of life, the stewardess was
in hers. They were congenial souls&#8212;all belonging to the same
great family, and Flora was not a little amused by the striking
points of resemblance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>Bidding adieu to the Captain of the steamer, the Lyndsays and
their luggage were safely landed on the chain-pier at Newhaven;
from thence they proceeded to Leith, to the house of a respectable
woman, the widow of a surgeon, who resided near the Leith bank,
and only a few minutes&#8217; walk from the wharf.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>MRS. WADDEL.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Great</span> was the surprise of Flora, when, instead of entering the
house by a front door, they walked up an interminable flight of
stone stairs, every landing comprising a distinct dwelling, or
flat (as it is technically termed), with the names of the
proprietors marked on the doors. At last they reached the flat
occupied by good Mistress Waddel, situated at the very top of this
stony region. Mrs. Waddel was at the door ready to receive them.
She showed them into a comfortable sitting-room with windows
fronting the street, where a bright fire was blazing in a very
old-fashioned grate. She welcomed her new lodgers with a torrent
of kindly words, pronounced in the broadest Scotch dialect, only
half understood by the English portion of her audience.</p>

<p>A large portly personage was Mrs. Waddel,&#8212;ugly, amiable, and by
no means particular in her dress; which consisted of a woollen
plaid, very much faded, and both ragged and dirty. Her large mutch
with its broad frills formed a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> glory round her head,
setting off to no advantage her pock-marked, flabby face, wide
mouth and yellow projecting teeth. She had a comical, good-natured
obliquity of vision in her prominent light-grey eyes, which were
very red about the rims; and Flora thought, as she read with an
inquiring eye the countenance of their landlady, that without
being positively disgusting, she was the most ordinary, uncouth
woman she ever beheld.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waddel was eloquent in the praise of her apartments, which
she said had been occupied by my Leddy W. when his Majesty George
the Fourth, God bless his saucy face, landed at Leith, on his
visit to Scotland. Her lodgings, it seemed, had acquired quite an
aristocratic character since the above-named circumstance; and not
a day passed, but the good woman enumerated all the particulars of
that memorable visit. But her own autobiography was the stock
theme with the good landlady. The most minute particulars of her
private history she daily divulged, to the unspeakable delight of
the mischievous laughter-loving James Hawke, who, because he saw
that it annoyed Mrs. Lyndsay, was sure to lead the conversation
slily to some circumstance which never failed to place the
honest-hearted Scotchwoman on her high-horse: and then she would
talk,&#8212;ye gods!&#8212;how she would talk&#8212;and splutter away in her
broad provincial dialect, until the wicked boy was convulsed with
laughter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&#8220;Ay, Mister Jeames,&#8221; she would say, &#8220;ye will a&#8217; be maken&#8217; yer fun
o&#8217; a&#8217; puir auld bodie, but &#8217;tis na&#8217; cannie o&#8217; ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Making fun of <em>you</em>, Mrs. Waddel,&#8221; said he, with a sly glance at
Flora, &#8220;how can you take such an odd notion into your head! It is
so good of you to tell me all about your courtship: it&#8217;s giving me
a hint of how I&#8217;m to go about it when I&#8217;m a man. I am sure you
were a very pretty, smart girl in your young days&#8221;&#8212;with another
quizzical glance at Flora.</p>

<p>The old lady drew herself up, and smiled approvingly upon her
black-eyed tormentor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Na, na, Mister Jeames, my gude man that&#8217;s dead an&#8217; gane said to
me, the verra day that he made me his ain&#8212;&#8216;Katie, ye are nae
bonnie, but ye a&#8217; gude, which is a&#8217; hantle better.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt he was right, Mrs. Waddel; but I really think he was
very ungallant to say so on his wedding-day, and did not do you
half justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weel, weel,&#8221; said the good dame, &#8220;every ain to his taste. He was
not ow&#8217;r gifted that way himsel; but we are nane sensible o&#8217; our
ain defects.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great attraction in the small, windowless closet in which
James slept, was an enormous calabash, which her son, the idol of
Mrs. Waddel&#8217;s heart, had brought home with him from the South
Seas. Over this calabash, the simple-hearted mother daily
rehearsed all the wonderful adventures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> she had gathered from that
individual, during his short visits home; and as she possessed a
surprisingly retentive memory, her maternal reminiscences would
have filled volumes,&#8212;to all of which James listened with the most
earnest attention, not on account of the adventures, for they were
commonplace enough, but for the mere pleasure of hearing Mrs.
Waddel talk broad Scotch, from which he seemed to derive the most
ludicrous enjoyment. Mrs. Waddel had two daughters, to whom nature
had been less bountiful than even to herself. Tall, awkward,
shapeless dawdles, whose unlovely youth was more repulsive than
the mother&#8217;s full-blown, homely age,&#8212;with them the old lady&#8217;s
innocent obliquity of vision had degenerated into a downright
squint, and the redness round the rims of their large,
fishy-looking, light eyes, gave the idea of perpetual weeping,&#8212;a
pair of Niobes, versus the beauty, whose swollen orbs were always
dissolved in tears. They crept slip-shod about the house, their
morning wrappers fitting so easily their slovenly figures, that
you expected to see them suddenly fall to the ground, and the
young ladies walk on in native simplicity.</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughters are like mysel&#8212;na&#8217; bonnie,&#8221; said Mrs. Waddel. &#8220;They
dinna&#8217; tak&#8217; wi&#8217; the men folk, wha look mair to comeliness than
gudeness now-a-days in a wife. A&#8217; weel, every dog maun ha&#8217; his
day, an&#8217; they may get husbands yet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>&#8220;I weel remember, when Noncy was a bairn, she was the maist ugsome
wee thing I ever clappit an e&#8217;e upon. My Leddy W. lodged in this
verra room, in the which we are no&#8217; sittin&#8217;. She had a daughter
nearly a woman grown, an&#8217; I was in my sma&#8217; back parlour washin&#8217;
an&#8217; dressin&#8217; the bairn. In runs my Leddy Grace, an&#8217; she stood an&#8217;
lookit an&#8217; lookit a lang time at the naked bairn in my lap: at
last she clappit her hands an&#8217; she called oot to her
mither&#8212;&#8216;Mamma! Mamma! for gudeness sake, come here, an&#8217; look at
this ugly, blear-eyed, bandy-legget child!&#8212;I never saw sic an
object in a&#8217; my life!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It made my heart sair to hear her despise a creture made in God&#8217;s
image in that way, an&#8217; I bursted into tears, an&#8217; said&#8212;&#8217;My leddy,
yer a bad Christian to spier in that way o&#8217; my puir bairn, an&#8217;
that in the hearin&#8217; of its ain mither. May God forgive you! but
you ha&#8217; a hard heart.&#8217; She was verra angry at my reproof, but my
Leddy W. just then came in, an&#8217; she said, with one of her ain
gracious smiles&#8212;&#8216;For shame! Grace; the bairn&#8217;s weel enough. Let
us hope she maun prove a&#8217; blessin&#8217; to her parents. The straightest
tree does na always bear the finest fruit.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ha&#8217; met wi&#8217; mony crosses and sair trials in my day; but few o&#8217;
them made me shed bitterer tears than that proud, handsom&#8217; young
leddy&#8217;s speech on the deformity o&#8217; my puir bairn.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>Flora stood reproved in her own eyes, for she knew she had
regarded the poor ugly girls with feelings of repugnance, on
account of their personal defects. Even Jim, careless and reckless
though he was, possessed an excellent heart, and he looked grave,
and turned to the window, and tried to hum a tune, to get rid of
an unpleasant sensation about his throat, which Mrs. Waddel&#8217;s
artless words had suddenly produced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang me!&#8221; he muttered half aloud, &#8220;if I ever laugh at the poor
girls again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Waddel had in common with most of her sex, a great
predilection for going to auctions; and scarcely a day passed
without her making some wonderful bargains. For a mere trifle she
had bought a &#8217;gude pot, only upon inspection it turned out to be
miserably leaky. A nice palliasse, which on more intimate
acquaintance proved alive with gentry with whom the most
republican body would not wish to be on intimate terms. Jim was
always joking the old lady upon her bargains, greatly to the
edification of Betty Fraser, a black-eyed Highland girl, who was
Mistress Waddel&#8217;s prime minister in the culinary department.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weel, Mister Jeames, jist ha&#8217; yer laugh oot, but when ye get a
glint o&#8217; the bonnie table I bought this mornin&#8217; for three an&#8217;
saxpence, ye&#8217;ll be noo&#8217; makin&#8217; game o&#8217; me ony mair, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Betty, ye maun jist step ow&#8217;r the curb-stane to the broker&#8217;s, an&#8217;
bring hame the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away sped the nimble-footed Betty, and we soon heard the
clattering of the table, as the leaves flapped to and fro as she
lugged it up the public stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the great bargain!&#8221; exclaimed the saucy Jim; &#8220;I think,
Mrs. Waddel, I&#8217;ll buy it of you, as my venture to Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did ye ever!&#8221; exclaimed the old lady, her eyes brightening as
Betty dragged in the last bargain, and placed it triumphantly
before her mistress. Like the Marquis of Anglesea, it had been in
the wars, and with a terrible clatter, the incomparable table fell
prostrate to the floor. Betty opened her great black eyes with a
glance of blank astonishment, and raising her hands with a tragic
air which was perfectly irresistible, exclaimed, &#8220;Mercy me, but it
wants a fut!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221; screamed Jim, as he sank beside the fallen table and
rolled upon the ground in a fit of irrepressible merriment; &#8220;Do,
for Heaven&#8217;s sake, tell me the English for a fut. Oh dear, I shall
die! Why do you make such funny purchases, Mrs. Waddel, and suffer
Betty to show them off in such a funny way? You will be the death
of me, indeed you will; and then, what will my Mammy <a name="quote4" id="quote4"></a><ins title="&#8217; in original">say?&#8221;</ins></p>

<p>To add to this ridiculous scene, Mrs. Waddel&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> grey parrot, who
was not the least important personage in her establishment, having
been presented to her by her sailor son, fraternised with the
prostrate lad, and echoed his laughter in the most outrageous
manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whist, Poll! Hould yer clatter. It&#8217;s no laughing matter to lose
three an&#8217; saxpence in buying the like o&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Waddel did not attend another auction during the month the
Lyndsays occupied her lodgings. With regard to Betty Fraser, Jim
picked up a page out of her history, which greatly amused Flora
Lyndsay, who delighted in the study of human character. We will
give it here.</p>

<p>Betty Fraser&#8217;s first mistress was a Highland lady, who had married
and settled in Edinburgh. On her first confinement, she could
fancy no one but a Highland girl to take care of the babe, when
the regular nurse was employed about her own person. She therefore
wrote to her mother to send her by the first vessel which sailed
for Edinburgh, a good, simple-hearted girl, whom she could
occasionally trust with the baby. Betty, who was a tenant&#8217;s
daughter, and a humble scion of the great family tree, duly
arrived by the next ship.</p>

<p>She was a hearty, healthy, rosy girl of fourteen, as rough as her
native wilds, with a mind so free from guile that she gave a
literal interpretation to everything she saw and heard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>In Canada Betty would have been considered very green. In Scotland
she was regarded as a truthful, simple-hearted girl. A few weeks
after the baby was born, some ladies called to see Mrs. &#8212;&mdash;. The
weather was very warm, and one of them requested the neat
black-eyed girl in waiting to fetch her a glass of water. Betty
obeyed with a smiling face; but oh, horror of horrors, she brought
the clear crystal to the lady guest in her red fist.</p>

<p>The lady smiled, drank the water, and returned the tumbler to the
black-eyed Hebe, who received it with a profound curtsy.</p>

<p>When the visitors were gone, Mrs. &#8212;&mdash;, who was very fond of her
young clanswoman, called her to her side, and said, &#8220;Betty, let me
never see you bring anything into my room in your bare hands.
Always put what you are asked for on to a waiter or an ashat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl promised obedience.</p>

<p>The very next day some strange ladies called; and after
congratulating Mrs. &#8212;&mdash; on her speedy recovery, they expressed an
earnest wish to see the &#8220;<em>dear little baby</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. &#8212;&mdash; rang the bell. Betty appeared. &#8220;Is the baby awake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my leddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just bring him in to show these ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty darted into the nursery, only too proud of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> the mission, and
telling nurse to &#8220;mak&#8217; the young laird brau,&#8221; she rushed to the
kitchen, and demanded of the cook a &#8220;muckle big ashat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want with the dish?&#8221; said the English cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my ain business,&#8221; quoth Betty, taking the enormous china
platter from the cook&#8217;s hand, and running back to the nursery.
&#8220;Here, Mistress Norman, here is ain big enough to hand him in, at
ony rate. Pray lay his wee duds smooth, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tak&#8217; him in, for
I hear the bell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are ye duff, lass? Wud ye put the bairn on the ashat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, mistress tauld me to bring what she asked me for on an ashat.
Sure ye wud no ha&#8217; me disobey her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na, na,&#8221; said the nurse, laughing, and suspecting some odd
mistake. &#8220;Ye sal ha&#8217; it yer ain way.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she carefully laid the noble babe upon the dish, and went
before to open the door that led to Mrs. &#8212;&mdash;&#8217;s chamber.</p>

<p>Betty entered as briskly as her unwieldy burden would permit, and
with glowing cheeks, and eyes glistening with honest delight,
presented her human offering in the huge dish to the oldest female
visitor in the room.</p>

<p>With a scream of surprise, followed by a perfect hurricane of
laughter, the venerable dame received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> the precious gift from
Betty&#8217;s hand, and holding it towards the astonished mother,
exclaimed, &#8220;Truly, my dear friend, this is a dish fit to set
before a king. Our beloved sovereign would have no objection of
seeing a dish so filled with royal fruit, placed at the head of
his own table.&#8221;</p>

<p>The laugh became general; and poor Betty comprehending the blunder
she had committed, not only fled from the scene, but dreading the
jokes of her fellow-servants, fled from the house.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>CLIMBING THE MOUNTAINS.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> Lyndsays, to their infinite mortification and disappointment,
found upon their arrival at Leith, that the <em>Chieftain</em>, in which
vessel their places had been taken for Canada, had sailed only two
days before. To make bad worse, Mrs. Waddel confidently affirmed,
that it was the very last vessel which would sail that season.</p>

<p>Lyndsay, who never yielded to despondency, took these contrary
events very philosophically, and lost no time in making inquiries
among the ship-owners, to ascertain whether Mrs. Waddel was right.</p>

<p>After several days of anxious and almost hopeless search, he was
at last informed that the <em>Flora</em>, Captain Ayre, was to leave for
Canada in a fortnight. The name seemed propitious, and that very
afternoon he walked down with his wife to inspect the vessel.</p>

<p>The <em>Flora</em> was a small brig, very old, very dirty, and with
wretched accommodations. The captain was a brutal-looking person,
blind of one eye, and very lame. Every third word he uttered was
an oath; and instead of answering Mr. Lyndsay&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> inquiries, he was
engaged in a blasphemous dialogue with his two sons, who were his
first and second mates. The young men seemed worthy of their
parentage; their whole conversation being interloaded with
frightful imprecations on their own limbs and souls, and the limbs
and souls of others.</p>

<p>They had a very large number of steerage passengers engaged, for
the very small size of the vessel, and these emigrants were of the
very lowest description.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us go in this horrible vessel,&#8221; whispered Flora to her
husband. &#8220;What a captain! what a crew! we shall be miserable, if
we form any part of her live cargo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear, my dear girl, there is no alternative. We may, perhaps,
hear of another before she sails. I won&#8217;t engage places in her
until the last moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dread of going in the <em>Flora</em> took a hold of the mind of her
namesake; and she begged Jim to be on the constant look-out for
another vessel.</p>

<p>During their stay at Leith, Lyndsay was busily employed in writing
a concluding chapter to his work on the Cape; and Flora amused
herself by taking long walks, accompanied by James, the maid, and
the baby, in order to explore all the beauties of Edinburgh. The
lad, who was very clever, and possessed a wonderful faculty of
remembering places and of finding his way among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> difficulties,
always acted as guide on these occasions. Before he had been a
week at Leith, he knew every street in Edinburgh; had twice or
thrice climbed the heights of Arthur&#8217;s Seat, and visited every
nook in the old castle. There was not a ship in the harbour of
Leith, but he not only knew her name and the name of her captain,
but he had made himself acquainted with some of her crew, and
could tell her freight and tonnage, her age and capabilities, the
port from which she last sailed and the port to which she was then
bound, as well as any sailor on the wharf. It was really
extraordinary to listen of an evening to the lad&#8217;s adventures, and
all the mass of information he had acquired during his long
rambles through the day.</p>

<p>Flora was always in an agony lest James should be lost, or meet
with some mishap during his exploring expeditions; but Mistress
Waddel comforted her with the assurance, &#8220;That a cat, throw her
which way you wu&#8217;d, lighted a&#8217; upon her feet. That nought was
never tent&#8212;an&#8217; they that war&#8217; born to be hanget wu&#8217;d never be
drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, one fine afternoon in June, Flora took it into her head, that
she would climb to the top of the mountain, the sight of which
from her chamber window she was never tired of contemplating. She
asked her husband to go with her. She begged, she entreated, she
coaxed; but he was just writing the last pages of his long task,
and he told her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> that if she would only wait until the next day,
he would go with pleasure.</p>

<p>But with Flora, it was this day or none. She had set her whole
heart and soul upon going up to the top of the mountain, and to
the top of the mountain she determined to go. This resolution was
formed, in direct opposition to her husband&#8217;s wishes; and with a
perfect knowledge of the tale of the dog Ball, which had been one
of her father&#8217;s stock stories, the catastrophe of which she had
known from a child. Lyndsay did not tell her positively she should
not go without him; and unable to control her impatience, she gave
him the slip, and set off with Jim, who was only too eager for the
frolic, on her mountain climbing expedition.</p>

<p>Flora was a native of a rich pastoral country; very beautiful in
running brooks, smooth meadows, and majestic parks; where the fat
sleek cattle so celebrated in the London markets, graze knee-deep
in luxuriant pastures, and the fallow deer <a name="browse" id="browse"></a><ins title="browze in original">browse</ins> and gambol
beneath the shadow of majestic oaks through the long bright summer
days. She had never seen a mountain before her visit to the North,
in her life; had never risen higher in the world than to the top
of Shooter&#8217;s Hill; and when <a name="they" id="they"></a><ins title="the in original">they</ins> arrived at the foot of this grand
upheaving of nature, she began to think the task more formidable
than she had imagined at a distance. Her young conductor, agile as
a kid, bounded up the steep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> acclivity with as much ease as if he
was running over a bowling-green.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, Jim!&#8221; cried Flora, pausing to draw breath. &#8220;I cannot
climb like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim was already beyond hearing, and was lying on the ground
peering over a projecting crag at least two hundred feet above her
head, and impishly laughing at the slow progress she made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Jim! that&#8217;s cruel of you, to desert me in my hour of need,&#8221;
said Flora, shaking her hand at the young mad-cap. &#8220;Lyndsay was
right after all. I had better have waited till to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the path that wound round the mountain towards the
summit became narrower and narrower, and the ascent more steep and
difficult. Flora sat down upon a stone amid the ruins of the
chapel to rest, and to enjoy the magnificent prospect. The
contemplation of this sublime panorama for a while absorbed every
other feeling. She was only alive to a keen sense of the
beautiful; and while her eye rested on the lofty ranges of
mountains to the north and south, or upon the broad bosom of the
silver Forth, she no longer wondered at the enthusiastic
admiration expressed by the bards of Scotland for their romantic
land.</p>

<p>While absorbed in thought, and contrasting the present with the
past, a lovely boy of four years of age, in kilt and hose, his
golden curls flying in the wind, ran at full speed up the steep
side of the hill; a panting woman, without bonnet or shawl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
following hard upon his track, shaking her fist at him, and
vociferating her commands (doubtless for him to return) in Gaelic,
fled by.</p>

<p>On ran the laughing child, the mother after him; but as well might
a giant pursue a fairy.</p>

<p>Flora followed the path they had taken, and was beginning to enjoy
the keen bracing air of the hills, when she happened to cast her
eyes to the far-off meadows beneath. Her head grew suddenly giddy,
and she could not divest herself of the idea, that one false step
would send her to the plains below. Here was a most ridiculous and
unromantic position: she neither dared to advance nor retreat; and
she stood grasping a ledge of the rocky wall in an agony of
cowardice and irresolution. At this critical moment, the mother of
the run-away child returned panting from the higher ledge of the
mountain, and, perceiving Flora pale and trembling, very kindly
stopped and asked what ailed her.</p>

<p>Flora could not help laughing while she confessed her fears, lest
she should fall from the narrow footpath on which she stood. The
woman, though evidently highly amused at her distress, had too
much native kindliness of heart, which is the mother of genuine
politeness, to yield to the merriment which hovered about her
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye are na accustomed to the hills,&#8221; she said, in her northern
dialect, &#8220;or ye wa&#8217;d na dread a hillock like this. Ye suld ha&#8217;
been born whar I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> wa&#8217; born, to ken a mountain fra&#8217; a mole-hill.
There is my bairn, noo, I canna&#8217; keep him fra&#8217; the mountain. He
will gang awa&#8217; to the tap, an&#8217; only laughs at me when I spier to
him to come doon. It&#8217;s a&#8217; because he is sae weel begotten&#8212;an&#8217; all
his forbears war reared amang the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good woman sat down upon a piece of the loose rock, and
commenced a long history of herself, of her husband, and of the
great clan of Macdonald (to which they belonged), which at last
ended in the discovery, that her aristocratic spouse was a
Corporal in the Highland regiment then stationed in Edinburgh, and
that Flora, his wife, washed for the officers in the said
regiment&#8212;that the little Donald, with his wild-goat propensities,
was their only child, and so attached to the hills, that she could
not keep him confined to the meadows below! The moment her eye was
off him, his great delight was to lead her a dance up the
mountain, which, as she never succeeded in catching him, was quite
labour in vain.</p>

<p>All this, and more, the good-natured woman communicated in her
frank, desultory manner, as she led Flora down the steep, narrow
path which led to the meadows below. Her kindness did not end
here, for she walked some way up the road to put Mrs. Lyndsay in
the right track to regain her lodgings, for Flora, trusting to the
pilotage of Jim, was perfectly ignorant of the location.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>This Highland Samaritan indignantly refused the piece of silver
Flora proffered in return for her services. &#8220;Hout, leddy! keep the
siller! I wudna&#8217; tak&#8217; aught fra&#8217; ye o&#8217; the Sabbath-day for a
trifling act o&#8217; courtesy&#8212;na, na, I come of too gude bluid for
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a noble simplicity about the honest-hearted woman, which
was not lost upon Flora.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were not English,&#8221; thought Flora, &#8220;I should like to be
Scotch.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked rather crest-fallen, as she presented herself before
her Scotch husband, who laughed heartily over her misadventure,
and did not cease to tease her about her expedition to the
mountain, as long as they remained in its vicinity.</p>

<p>This did not deter her from taking a long stroll on the sands &#8220;o&#8217;
Leith,&#8221; the next afternoon, with James, who delighted in these
Quixotish rambles; and was always on the alert, to join in any
scheme which promised an adventure. It was a lovely afternoon. The
sun glittered on the distant waters, which girdled the golden
sands with a zone of blue and silver. The air was fresh and
elastic, and diffused a spirit of life and joyousness around.
Flora, as she followed the footsteps of her young agile conductor,
felt like a child again; and began to collect shells and
sea-weeds, with as much zest as she had done along her native
coast, in those far-off happy days, which at times returned to her
memory like some distinct, but distant dream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>For hours they wandered hither and thither, lulled by the sound of
the waters, and amused by their child-like employment; until Flora
remarked, that her footprints filled with water at each step, and
the full deep roaring of the sea gave notice of the return of the
tide. Fortunately they were not very far from the land; and oh,
what a race they had to gain the &#8220;Peir o&#8217; Leith,&#8221; before they were
overtaken by the waves. How thankful they felt that they were
safe, as the billows chased madly past, over the very ground,
which a few minutes before, they had so fearlessly trod.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is rather worse than the mountain, mamma Flora,&#8221; (a
favourite name with James for his friend Mrs. Lyndsay,) &#8220;and might
have been fatal to us both. I think Mr. Lyndsay would scold this
time, if he knew our danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t quarrel on the score of prudence. But what is this?&#8221;
said Flora; and she stepped up to a blank wall, on their homeward
path, and read aloud the following advertisement:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;To sail on the first of July, vi&#226; Quebec and Montreal; the fast
sailing brig <em>Anne</em>, Captain Williams. For particulars, inquire
at the office of P. Gregg, Bank Street, Leith.</p>

<p>&#8220;N.B. The <em>Anne</em> is the last ship which leaves this port, for
Canada, during the season.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Hurra!&#8221; cried the volatile Jim, flinging his cap into the air; &#8220;a
fig for Captain Ayre and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> <em>Flora</em>. I&#8217;d lay sixpence if I had
it, that we shall sail in the <em>Anne</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go, James, and look at the vessel,&#8221; cried Flora, clapping
her hands with delight. &#8220;Oh, if it had not been for our fright on
the sands, we should not have seen <a name="quote5" id="quote5"></a><ins title="omitted &#8221; in original">this.&#8221;</ins></p>

<p>Flora hastened home to inform her husband of the important
discovery they had made; and before half an hour had elapsed, she
found herself in company with him and Jim, holding a conference
with Captain Williams, in the little cabin of the <em>Anne</em>.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>THE BRIG ANNE</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Was</span> a small, old-fashioned, black-hulled vessel, marvellously
resembling a collier in her outward appearance. She was a
one-masted ship, of 180 tons burthen, and promised everything but
aristocratic accommodations for women and children.</p>

<p>The cabin was a low, square room, meant to contain only the
captain and his mate; whose berths, curtained with coarse red
stuff, occupied the opposite walls. The table in the centre was a
fixture, and the bench which ran round three sides of this crib,
was a fixture also; and though backed by the wall, was quite near
enough to the table to serve the double purpose of chair or sofa.
A small fireplace occupied the front of the cabin, at the side of
which, a door opened into a tiny closet, which the Captain
dignified with the name of his state-cabin. The compass was
suspended in a brass box from the ceiling,&#8212;articles of comfort or
luxury there were none.</p>

<p>The Captain, a stout, broad-shouldered, red-faced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> man, like
Captain Ayre of the <em>Flora</em>, was minus an eye; but the one which
fortune had left him was a piercer. He was a rough, blunt-looking
tar, some forty-five or fifty years of age; and looked about as
sentimental and polite as a tame bear. His coarse, weather-beaten
face had an honest, frank expression, and he bade his guests to be
seated with an air of such hearty hospitality, that they felt
quite at home in his narrow low den.</p>

<p>He had no cabin-passengers, though a great many in the steerage;
and he assured Flora that she could have the very best
accommodations, as he would resign the state-cabin to her and the
child. Mr. Lyndsay could occupy the mate&#8217;s berth in the cabin, and
they could not fail of being quite snug and comfortable.</p>

<p>The state-cabin was just big enough to hold the captain&#8217;s chest of
drawers, the top of which, boarded, and draped with the same faded
red stuff which decorated the outer room, formed the berth that
Flora was to occupy. Small as the place was, it was scrupulously
neat and clean, and possessed for Flora one great charm&#8212;that of
privacy. She could, by shutting the door and drawing the bolt, at
any time enjoy the luxury of finding herself, though in a crowded
vessel, alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma Flora, are you not charmed with the splendid accommodations
of your fancy ship?&#8221; whispered the mischievous Jim. &#8220;There is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
room for a flea to hop, without giving him the cramp in his legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is better than the <em>Flora</em>; so hold your tongue, you wicked
imp.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lyndsay thought otherwise. The <em>Flora</em> was larger, and was to
sail a fortnight earlier. He demurred&#8212;his wife coaxed and
entreated; but he only went so far as to tell the captain to keep
the berths unoccupied until the following day, and he would inform
him of his final determination.</p>

<p>Just as they were rising to take leave, a tall, lanky man, stuck
his long scraggy neck in at the cabin-door, and, in the broadest
Scotch vernacular, exclaimed,&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;To what port are ye bound, man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quebec and Montreal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull you tak&#8217; a cabin-passenger on reasonable terms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fare is fixed by the owner of the vessel, P. Gregg,
Bank-street, Leith. You had better apply to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weel, I dinna&#8217; think I&#8217;ll jest go noo. I want to see the Canada
lochs. Ane o&#8217; these days I&#8217;ll tak&#8217; passage wi&#8217; you onyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps a glass of brandy and water would serve your purpose at
this time,&#8221; said the captain, with a knowing smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noo objections, captain,&#8221; said the long-visaged traveller to
the lochs o&#8217; Canada.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s one way of getting a glass of brandy for nothing,&#8221; said
the captain, as he accompanied the Lyndsays to the deck. &#8220;That
fellow has as much notion of going to Canada, as I have of taking
a voyage to the moon. But he knows that I will give him the brandy
to get rid of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of the <em>Anne</em> and her captain, John?&#8221; said
Flora, as she took the proffered arm of her husband. &#8220;He is a
rough sailor, but looks like an honest man. And the ship, though
small, is clean, and offers better accommodations than the
<em>Flora</em>, where we should have to share a small cabin with fourteen
passengers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear wife, it may all be true what you say; but I have made up
my mind to go in the <em>Flora</em>. She sails so much earlier, that it
will be a great saving of time and expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora&#8217;s countenance fell; but she only muttered to herself,&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have such a horror of going in that ship!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the turning of the street they met Mr. Peterson, the owner of
the <em>Flora</em>, to whom Lyndsay had spoken about taking a passage in
her the day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Lyndsay,&#8221; said he, shaking hands in a friendly manner
with him; &#8220;have you concluded to take passage in my vessel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; returned Lyndsay, laughing. &#8220;My wife has such an
unconquerable aversion to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> going with your captain and his sons,
on account of the reprobate language they used the other day in
her hearing, that she has actually found up another vessel in
which she wishes me to sail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the <em>Anne</em>, Captain Williams,&#8221; said Peterson, with a
contemptuous smile,&#8212;&#8220;the last and the most insignificant vessel
which leaves our port. The owner, P. Gregg, is not a liberal
person to deal with; the captain is a good seaman, but a stubborn
brute,&#8212;quite as unfit for the society of ladies as Captain Ayre.
To tell you the truth, we have little choice in these matters. It
is not the manners of the men we employ we generally look to, but
to their nautical skill. There is, however, one great objection to
your taking passage in the <em>Anne</em>, which I think it right you
should know. She has a most objectionable freight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what respect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is loaded with brandy and gunpowder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means a pleasant cargo,&#8221; said Lyndsay. &#8220;What do you say to
that, Flora?&#8221; turning to his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you to-morrow: do wait until then.&#8221;</p>

<p>In order to pacify her evident uneasiness, Lyndsay promised to
postpone his decision.</p>

<p>When they reached their lodgings, they found a short, round-faced,
rosy, good-natured looking individual, waiting to receive them,
who introduced himself as Mr. Gregg, the owner of the <em>Anne</em>. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
had learned from Captain Williams, that they had been inspecting
the capabilities of his vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a small ship,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but safe; the captain, a steady,
experienced seaman; and if Mr. Lyndsay engaged a passage for
himself and family, he would grant the most liberal terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyndsay mentioned his objections to the freight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; asked the little owner, somewhat excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Peterson. We parted from him only a few minutes ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The scoundrel! the mean, dirty scoundrel!&#8221; said Gregg, stamping
on the floor. &#8220;Why, Sir, Mr. Lyndsay, his own ship carries the
same freight. What did he say about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me yesterday, she took out a general cargo&#8212;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of brandy and gunpowder. Both vessels are employed by the same
house, and take out the same freight. You must, however, please
yourself, Mr. Lyndsay. The <em>Flora</em> has a great number of
passengers of the lowest cast,&#8212;is old and crank; with the most
vicious, morose captain that sails from this port. I know him only
too well. He made two voyages for me; and the letters I received,
complaining of his brutal conduct to some of his passengers, I can
show you at my office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have said enough, Mr. Gregg, to deter me from taking my wife
and child in the <em>Flora</em>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> The deceitful conduct of Mr. Peterson
alone would have determined me not to contract with him. And now,
what will you take us for? Our party consists of my wife and
infant, a lad of thirteen years who accompanies us, a
servant-girl, and myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gregg considered for some minutes. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is
a large party of you; but I will give your wife, child, and self,
a cabin passage, finding you in the same fare as the captain, and
the lad and servant a second cabin passage, but the privilege of
the cabin-table, for thirty pounds. Is that too much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very liberal indeed. Peterson asked fifty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is reasonable; but as you have to wait a fortnight longer in
order to sail with me, I have taken that into account. Is it a
bargain?&#8221;</p>

<p>They struck hands; and Mr. Gregg, after drawing up an agreement,
which Lyndsay signed, turned to Mrs. Lyndsay, and pressingly
invited the whole party to spend the following afternoon with them
in a friendly way.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife is a homely little body,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but she will do her
best to make you comfortable, and will give you, at any rate, a
hearty Scotch welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Flora, are you not delighted in having it your own way?&#8221;
said Lyndsay, after Mr. Gregg left them. &#8220;But let me assure you,
my dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> wife, you owe it entirely to the mean conduct of Mr.
Peterson. I tell you frankly, that I would not have yielded my
better judgment to a mere prejudice, even to please you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are determined, John, that I shall never fulfil the gipsy&#8217;s
prophecy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I never tell you that story, nor the girls either? for it was
a standing joke against me at home for years. Oh, you must have it
then. But be generous, and don&#8217;t turn it as a weapon against me:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some years ago, a gipsy woman came to our kitchen-door, and asked
to see the young ladies of the house. Of course, we all ran out to
look at the sybil, and hear her errand, which was nothing more nor
less than to tell our fortunes. Partly out of curiosity, partly
out of fun, we determined to have a peep into futurity, and see
what the coming years had in store for us. We did not believe in
gipsy craft. We well knew that, like our own, the woman&#8217;s powers
were limited; that it was all guess-work; that her cunning rested
in a shrewd knowledge of character,&#8212;of certain likings springing
out of contrasts, which led her to match the tall with the short,
the fair with the dark, the mild with the impetuous, the sensitive
and timid with the bold and adventurous. On these seeming
contrarieties the whole art of fortune-telling, as far as my
experience goes, appears based.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>&#8220;Well, she gave husbands to us all&#8212;dark, fair,
middle-complexioned, short and tall, amiable, passionate, or
reserved&#8212;just the opposite of our own complexions or temperament,
such as she judged them to be; and she showed a great deal of
talent and keen perception of character in the choice of our
mates.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my case, however, she proved herself to be no prophet. I was
to marry a sea-faring gentleman&#8212;a tall, black-eyed, passionate
man&#8212;with whom I was to travel to foreign parts, and die in a
foreign land. I was to have no children; and he was to be very
jealous of me. &#8216;And yet, for all that,&#8217; quoth the gipsy, drawing
close up to me, and whispering in my ear, but not so low, but that
all the rest heard her concluding speech, &#8216;you shall wear the
breeches.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did not bargain that you were to marry a Scotchman,&#8221; said
Lyndsay, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor did she know, with all her pretended art, that my husband was
to be a soldier, fair-haired, and blue-eyed, and that this little
lass would give a direct contradiction to her prophecy,&#8221; and Flora
kissed fondly Josey&#8217;s soft cheek. &#8220;Well, I was so tormented about
that last clause in my fortune, that I determined it should never
come to pass; that whatever portion of my husband&#8217;s dress I
coveted, I would scrupulously avoid even the insertion of a toe
into his nether garments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget, Flora, your trip to the mountain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> without my
consent?&#8221; whispered Lyndsay, mischievously.</p>

<p>Flora coloured, stammered, and at last broke into a hearty
laugh,&#8212;&#8220;I was too great a coward, John, to wear them with
becoming dignity. If that was wearing the breeches, I am sure I
disgraced them with my worse than womanish fears. I will never put
them on again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear wife, I&#8217;ll take good care you shan&#8217;t. When a Scotchman
has any breeks to wear, he likes to keep them all to himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! we well know what a jealous, monopolising set you are. Let
any one attempt to interfere with your rights, and, like your
sturdy national emblem, you are armed to the teeth,&#8221; said Flora,
as she ran off to order tea.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>A VISIT TO THE SHIP OWNERS.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the afternoon of the following day our family party set
off to pay their promised visit. The weather was delightful, and
Flora was in an ecstasy of high spirits, as they turned from the
narrow streets of Leith into a beautiful lane, bounded on each
side by hawthorn hedges, redolent with the perfume of the
sweetbrier and honeysuckle. The breath of new-mown hay floated on
the air, and the lilac and laburnum, in full blossom, waved their
graceful boughs above the white palings which surrounded many a
pleasant country retreat, in which the tired citizen, after the
toils of the day in the busy marts of commerce, returned to enjoy
a comfortable dish of tea with his family.</p>

<p>A walk of half-a-mile brought them to the suburban retreat of the
worthy Mr. Gregg, and he was at the green garden-gate to receive
his guests, his honest, saucy face, radiant with an honest
welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was fearful ye wud not keep your promise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>&#8221; said he: &#8220;my
youngsters ha&#8217; been on the look-out for you for this hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he pushed the giggling youngsters forward, in the shape of
two bouncing, rosy-faced school-girls, who were playing at bo-peep
behind papa&#8217;s broad blue back, and whose red cheeks grew crimson
with blushes as he presented them to his guests.</p>

<p>James Hawke seemed to think the merry girls, who were of his own
age, well worth looking at, if you might judge by the roguish
sparkling of his fine black eyes, as he bounded off with them to
be introduced to the strawberry-beds, and all the other
attractions of the worthy citizen&#8217;s garden.</p>

<p>It was a large, old-fashioned house, which had seen better days,
and stood on a steep sloping hill, commanding a beautiful view of
Edinburgh. The grand old mountain loomed in the distance, and the
bright Forth, with all its wealth of white sails, glittered in the
rays of the declining sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a delightful situation!&#8221; exclaimed Flora, as her eye ranged
over the beautiful scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, &#8217;tis a bonnie place,&#8221; said Mr. Gregg, greatly exalted in his
own eyes, as master of the premises;&#8212;&#8220;an&#8217; very healthy for the
bairns. I often walked past this old house when I was but a
&#8217;prentice lad in the High-street, o&#8217; Sunday afternoons, and used
to peep through the pales, and admire the old trees, an&#8217; fruits,
an&#8217; flowers; an&#8217; I thought if I had sic a braw place of my ain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> I
should think mysel richer than a crow&#8217;ed king. I was a puir
callant in those days. It was only a dream, a fairy dream; yet
here I am, master of the auld house, and the pretty gardens.
Industry and prudence, my dear madam&#8212;industry and prudence, has
done it all, and converted my air-built castle into substantial
brick and stane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora admired the old man&#8217;s honest pride. She had thought him
coarse and vulgar, while in reality he was only what the Canadians
term <em>homely</em>; for his heart was brimful of kindly affections and
good feeling. There was not a particle of pretence about him,&#8212;of
forced growth or refined cultivation; a genuine product of the
soil, a respectable man in every sense of the word. Proud of his
country, and doubly proud of the wealth he had acquired by honest
industry. A little vain and pompous, perhaps, but most self-made
men are so: they are apt to overrate the talents which have lifted
them out of obscurity, and to fancy that the world estimates their
worth and importance by the same standard as they do themselves.</p>

<p>In the house, they were introduced to Mrs. Gregg, who was just
such a person as her husband had described: a cheerful,
middle-aged woman, very short, very stout, and very hospitable.
Early as it was, the tea-table was loaded with good cheer. Large
strawberries preserved whole, and that pet sweetmeat of the
Scotch, orange marmalade, looked tempting enough, in handsome
dishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> of cut glass, flanked by delicious home-made bread and
butter, cream, cheese, and sweet curds.</p>

<p>A tall, fine-looking woman, very gaily dressed, was presented to
the Lyndsays as Mrs. M&#8217;Nish, a married daughter. Her husband was a
loud-voiced, large-whiskered consequential-looking young man,
whose good humour and admiration of himself, his wife, his father
and mother-in-law, and the big house, appeared inexhaustible. His
young wife seemed to look upon him as something super-human; and
to every remark she made, she appealed to Wullie, as she called
him, for his verdict of approval.</p>

<p>Little Josey, who made one of the party, was soon on the most
intimate terms with the family group. The young married woman,
after bestowing upon her many kisses, passed her over to her
husband, telling him, with a little laugh, &#8220;that she wondered if
he would make a good nurse: it was time for him to commence
practising.&#8221; Then she blushed and giggled, and the old man
chuckled and rubbed his knees, and the mother looked up with a
quiet smile as the jolly bridegroom burst into a loud laugh. &#8220;Ay,
Jean my woman, it&#8217;s time enough to think o&#8217; troubles when they
come.&#8221; And then he tossed Miss Josey up to the ceiling with such
vigorous jerks, that Flora watched his gymnastics in nervous fear
lest the child should fall out of his huge grasp and break her
neck.</p>

<p>Not so Josey; she never was better pleased in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> her life; she
crowed and screamed with delight, and rewarded her Scotch nurse,
by tangling her tiny white fingers in his bushy red whiskers, and
pulling his long nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haut! you&#8217;re a speretted lass. Is that the way you mean to lead
the men?&#8221; he said, as he bounced her down into his wife&#8217;s lap, and
told her, &#8220;that it was her turn to mak&#8217; a trial o&#8217; that kind o&#8217;
wark, an&#8217; see how it wud fit: he was verra&#8217; sure he sud sune be
tired o&#8217;t.&#8221; And this speech was received with another giggle,
followed by a loud laugh.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was impatient to discuss the important business
of tea-drinking; after which he proposed to have the pleasure of
showing his visitors the garden, and some other grand sight of
which he would not speak now, but which he was certain must be
appreciated by every person, who possessed a half-pennyworth of
<a name="quote6" id="quote6"></a><ins title="extraneous &#8221; in original">taste.</ins></p>

<p>Flora sat down to the table, wondering what they could be.</p>

<p>Big Wullie stepped to the hall-door, and summoned the children to
the evening meal with a loud hallo! which was answered from among
the trees by a jovial shout, and in a few minutes the young folks
poured into the room, some of them looking rather dull, from their
protracted visit to the strawberry-beds.</p>

<p>The fresh air and exercise had given Mrs. Lyndsay an unusual
appetite. She enjoyed her meal, but this did not satisfy the
overflowing hospitality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> of her entertainers, who pressed her in
every possible manner to take more, till she felt very much
inclined to answer with the poor country girl, &#8220;Dear knows, I
can&#8217;t eat another bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no way of satisfying the entreaties of the Greggs, but
by making a retreat from the table, and even then they persisted
in declaring their guests had been starved, and would not do the
least justice to their good cheer.</p>

<p>This mistaken kindness brought to Flora&#8217;s mind a story she had
heard Lyndsay tell of a merchant of Edinburgh who went to the
north of Scotland to visit some country folk who were his near
relations. The good people were outrageously glad to see him, and
literally killed the fatted calf, and concocted all sorts of
country dainties in order to celebrate the advent of their
distinguished guest, who it seems, in this case, was in less
danger of starving than of being stuffed to death.</p>

<p>Having partaken at dinner of all, and perhaps of rather more than
he required, he did his best to resist their further importunities
for him to eat <em>more</em>, but finding his refusal to do so increased
their anxiety to force upon him the good things they had to
bestow, he spread a large silk pocket-handkerchief upon his knees,
under cover of the table-cloth, into which he contrived
dexterously to empty the contents of his plate, whenever the eye
of his watchful hostess was off him. At last, even her
importunities for him to continue the feast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> grew fainter, and she
wound up by exclaiming, &#8220;You ha&#8217; made a verra puir dinner, Sir; ye
ha&#8217; just eaten nothing ava&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this speech, hardly able to keep his gravity, he placed his
handkerchief upon the table, and displayed its contents of fish,
flesh, fowl, and confectionaries, to his astonished entertainers,
exclaiming, as he did so, &#8220;My dear Madam, think what would have
become of me, had I eaten all this!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was no feast of reason, at the honest Greggs; the entertainment
was of the most animal kind, and Flora felt relieved when it was
over, and the whole party issued once more into the pure air.</p>

<p>She was just hastening to a parterre, gay with roses, to rifle
some of its sweets, when the old gentleman came panting hard upon
her track. &#8220;Ye must come an&#8217; see my raree-show, before the sun
gangs doun,&#8221; he cried; and Flora turned and followed him back into
the house. In the hall the whole family party were collected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll gang first, father, and open the door,&#8221; cried a merry boy of
fourteen, and beckoning to Jim, they both clattered after each
other up the old-fashioned stairs.</p>

<p>Old houses in Edinburgh and its vicinity are so high, one would
think the people in those days wished to build among the stars; at
least to emulate the far-famed wonders of that
language-confounding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> tower, which caused the first emigration, by
scattering the people over the face of the earth.</p>

<p>They went up, and up, and up, until there seemed no end to the
broad, short steps. On the last flight, which led to the roof, the
staircase had so greatly contracted its proportions, that fat Mr.
Gregg could scarcely force himself up it, and he so completely
obscured the light which peered down upon them from a small
trap-door, opening upon the leads, that Flora, who followed him,
found herself in a dim twilight, and expected every moment the
panting mountain, which had come between her and the sky, would
lose the centre of gravity, and suffocate her in its fall.</p>

<p>No such tragic misfortune, however, occurred. The old gentleman
forced himself, after much squeezing and puffing off steam,
through the narrow aperture, and very gallantly lent a hand to
assist Flora on to the leads.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a strait gate, on a narrow way,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;But tell me,
if it does na&#8217; gie ye a glimpse o&#8217; heaven?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man was right. Flora stood entranced, as it were, with the
glorious spectacle which burst upon her sight, the moment she
stepped upon the roof of that old house. Edinburgh, and the world
of beauty that lies around it, lay at her feet, bathed in the
golden light of a gorgeous June sunset. To those who have beheld
that astonishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> panorama, all description must prove abortive.
It is a sight to be daguerreotyped upon the heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weel, was it not worth toiling up yon weary stair, to get sic a
glimpse as that, of the brave auld town?&#8221; said honest P. Gregg.
&#8220;I&#8217;m jest thinkin&#8217; I must enlarge the stair, or diminish mysel,
before I can venture through that narrow pass again. An&#8217;, my dear
leddy, I can do neither the one nor the other. So this mayhap may
be my last glint o&#8217; the bonnie auld place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went on, after his quaint fashion, to point out to
Mistress Lyndsay all the celebrated spots in the neighbourhood,
which every Scot knows by heart, and Flora was so much amused and
interested by his narration, that she was sorry when the deepening
shades of approaching night warned the old man that it required
daylight to enable him to descend the narrow stair, and they
reluctantly left the scene.</p>

<small>FLORA&#8217;S DINNER.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Lyndsay</span> had some literary friends in Edinburgh, whose kindly
intercourse greatly enhanced the pleasure of a month&#8217;s residence
near the metropolis of Scotland. The foremost among these was
M&#8212;&mdash;, the poet, who, like Lyndsay, was a native of the Orkney
Islands. Having been entertained at the house of this gentleman,
he naturally wished to return his courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flora,&#8221; said he, addressing his wife, the day after their visit
to the Greggs, &#8220;do you think you could manage a dinner for a few
friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora dropped her work, and opened her eyes in blank dismay at the
very idea of such a thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, in these poor lodgings? and Mrs. Waddel such an
impracticable, helpless old body? My dear John, it is impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, Lyndsay had set his heart upon the dinner, which he thought
not only very possible, but could see no difficulty at all about
it. Men never look behind the scenes, or consider the minor
details of such things; and on these trifling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> items, in their
eyes, the real success or failure of most domestic arrangements
depend. But Flora had been behind the scenes, and knew all about
it, to her cost, for it was with the greatest difficulty she could
prevail upon Mrs. Waddel to cook the plainest food. Mrs. Waddel
declared she could &#8220;na fash hersel about; that dainties were a&#8217;
verra weel, but the meat ate jest as sweet without them.&#8221; The idea
of such a tardy mistress of the kitchen cooking a dinner for
company, appeared perfectly ridiculous to Flora, who knew that any
attempt of the kind must end in mortification and disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flora,&#8221; said Lyndsay, quite seriously, &#8220;I am certain that you
could manage it quite well, if you would only make the trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is from no unwillingness on my part that I object to your
entertaining your friends. But there is but one cooking range in
the house, and that one small and inconvenient, and I fear the
cooking utensils are limited to the dimensions of the <a name="quote7" id="quote7"></a><ins title="omitted &#8221; in original">fire.&#8221;</ins></p>

<p>&#8220;There is a large fireplace in our bed-chamber, Flora,&#8221; said
Lyndsay, unwilling to beat a retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; replied Flora, musingly; &#8220;I did not think of that. It
would do that damp, cold room good to get a fire lighted in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing her husband determined upon the dinner, she began to
question him as to the items of the entertainment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, nothing particular, dear. M&#8212;&mdash; knows that we are in
lodgings, and can&#8217;t manage as well as if we were in a house of our
own. A nice cut of fresh salmon, which is always to be had in the
fish-market, a small roast of beef, or leg of mutton, with
vegetables and a pudding, will do; and, above all things, Flora,
don&#8217;t look annoyed, if every thing does not exactly please you, or
it will only make matters worse. I am going to call upon M&#8212;&mdash;
this morning, and I will ask him and his friend P&#8212;&mdash;to step over
and dine with us at six o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do for wine and spirits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will order these as I go along. So mind, dear, and have
everything as snug and comfortable as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the anxiety she felt as to the success of the dinner,
Flora could not help pausing to admire the spacious fish-market,
with its cool stone pavement and slabs of white marble, on which
lay piled in magnificent profusion, the most beautiful specimens
of the finny rangers of the deep. Filled with marine curiosities,
she could have spent hours in contemplating the picturesque groups
it presented. There lay the salmon in its delicate coat of blue
and silver; the mullet, in pink and gold; the mackerel, with its
blending of all hues,&#8212;gorgeous as the tail of the peacock, and
defying the art of the painter to transfer them to his canvas; the
plaice, with its olive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> green coat, spotted with vivid orange,
which must flash like sparks of flame glittering in the depths of
the dark waters; the cod, and the siller haddies, all freckled
with brown, and silver, and gold; the snake-like eel, stretching
its slimy length along the cool stone pavement, among moving heaps
of tawny crabs&#8212;those spiders of the deep&#8212;which seemed to emulate
the scorpion-like lobsters near them in repulsive ugliness.</p>

<p>But what most enchanted Flora, was the antique costume of the
Newhaven fish-women, as, seated upon their upturned baskets, they
called the attention of the visitor to their various stores of
fish.</p>

<p>Flora was never tired of looking at these sea-maids and matrons.
Their primitive appearance, and quaint, old-fashioned dress, took
her fancy greatly&#8212;with their short petticoats, their blue
stockings and buckled shoes, their neat, striped linen-jackets,
and queer little caps, just covering the top of their head, and
coming down in long, straight mobs, over their ears; their honest,
broad features, and pleasant faces, which had been fair before the
sun and the sea air tanned them to that warm, deep brown; their
round, red arms, and handsome feet and legs, displayed with a
freedom and ease which custom had robbed of all indecorum, and
rendered natural and proper.</p>

<p>Flora wished that she had been an artist, to copy some of the fine
forms she saw among these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> fish-girls&#8212;forms which had been left
as the great God of nature made them, uncrippled by torturing
stays and tight vestments. How easy their carriage! with what rude
grace they poised upon their heads their ponderous baskets, and
walked erect and firm, filling the air with their
mournfully-musical cry! The great resemblance between these people
and the Bavarian broom-girls, both in features and costume,
impressed her with the idea, that they had originally belonged to
the same race. The Newhaven sea-nymph, however, is taller, and has
a more imposing presence, than the short, snub-nosed Bavarian.</p>

<p>But time, that waits on no one&#8217;s fancy or caprice, warned her that
she must not linger over a scene which she afterwards visited with
renewed pleasure, but gave her a gentle hint, that there was work
to be done at home&#8212;that she had better make her purchases and
proceed to business.</p>

<p>She returned, therefore, to her lodgings in high spirits,
despatching Jim to the greengrocer&#8217;s in the next street, and then
followed Hannah and her basket into Mrs. Waddel&#8217;s kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marcy me! what ha&#8217; ye got, the noo?&#8221; said Mistress Waddel,
lifting the napkin from the basket: &#8220;meat enough, I declare, to
last the hale week. The weather&#8217;s owr hot, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, for a&#8217;
they to keep sweet sae lang.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Waddel, I expect two gentlemen to dinner, particular friends
of Mr. Lyndsay; and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> want you to cook these things for me as
well as you can,&#8221; said Flora <a name="comma3" id="comma3"></a><ins title="original had .,">coaxingly.</ins></p>

<p>&#8220;Twa&#8217; gentlemen, did ye say?&#8212;There&#8217;s ten times mair in yon basket
than twa gentlemen can eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there is; but we cannot stint our guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whist, woman!&#8221; cried Mrs. Waddel, &#8220;it makes my heid ache only to
think about a&#8217; that roast an&#8217; boil, an&#8217; boil an&#8217; <a name="quote8" id="quote8"></a><ins title="omitted &#8221; in original">roast!&#8221;</ins></p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, how did you contrive to cook for Lady Weyms?&#8221; asked Flora,
rather indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gudeness gracious! Do ye think, that my Leddy Weyms cared for the
cooking o&#8217; the like o&#8217; me? When his late majestie, God bless him,
honoured our auld toon wi&#8217; his preesence, folk were glad to get a
deecent place to cover their heids, an&#8217; war in no wise owr
particlar, sae they could get lodged ava.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I should think, when a titled lady put up with such as these;
where the mistress engages to cook for her lodgers, and has not a
whole pot in her culinary establishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Leddy brought her ain cook, an&#8217; she had my twa best rooms jest
aff the passage, whar&#8217; Captain Macpherson bides the noo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you manage to cook for him?&#8221; asked Flora, very
sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He keeps a man. An auld soger, whar&#8217; does the cooking himsel.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>However, the dinner went off better than could have been expected,
though little praise could be conscientiously given to the
cooking. The fish was done <em>too much</em>, the ham <em>too little</em>, and
the baked fowls looked hard and dry. The pastry was the only thing
at table about which no fault could be found.</p>

<p>After the cloth was removed, Flora gave the poet and his friend
the history of the dinner, which so amused Mr. M., that he
declared it was worth twenty dinners hearing her relate the
misadventures of the morning. Flora forgot the disasters of the
day while enjoying the conversation of Mr. M. and his friend,&#8212;men
who had won by their genius no common literary reputation in the
world; and the short hour &#8220;ayont the twal&#8221; had been tolled some
time from all the steeples in Edinburgh before the little party
separated, mutually pleased with each other, never to meet in this
world of change again.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span><a name="XXVI" id="XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>FEARS OF THE CHOLERA&#8212;DEPARTURE FROM SCOTLAND.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> cholera, which had hitherto only claimed a few victims in the
city, now began to make fearful progress; and every day enlarged
the catalogue of the dead, and those who were labouring under this
awful disease. People seemed unwilling to name the ravages of the
plague to each other; or spoke of it in low, mysterious tones, as
a subject too dreadful for ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>Just at this time Flora fell ill, and was forced to keep her bed
for several days. During the time she was confined to her chamber,
Mrs. Waddel kept up a constant lamentation, declaring that the
reputation of her lodgings would be lost for ever, if Mrs. Lyndsay
should die of the cholera. Yet, to do the good creature justice,
she waited upon her, and nursed her with most unselfish kindness;
making gallons of gruel, which the invalid scarcely tasted, and
recommending remedies which, if adopted, would have been certain
to kill the patient, for whose life she most earnestly and
devoutly prayed.</p>

<p>The very morning that Mrs. Lyndsay was able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> to leave her bed, her
husband got a note from Mr. Gregg, informing him that the <em>Anne</em>
was to sail at four o&#8217;clock the next day.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Flora,&#8221; said Lyndsay, tenderly, &#8220;I fear you are not able
to go in your present weak state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I shall be better for the change. This frightful cholera
is spreading on all sides. The sooner, dear John, we can leave
this place the better. Two persons, Mrs. Waddel told me, died last
night of it, only a few doors off. I know that it is foolish to be
afraid of an evil which we cannot avoid; but I find it impossible
to divest myself of this fear. I look worse than I feel just now,&#8221;
she continued, walking across the room, and surveying her face in
the glass. &#8220;My colour is returning&#8212;I shall pass muster with the
doctors yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great business of packing up for the voyage went steadily
forward all day; and before six in the evening, trunks, bedding,
and little ship stores, were on board, ready for a start.</p>

<p>Flora was surprised in the afternoon by a visit from Mr. and Mrs.
Gregg, and the two rosy girls, who expressed the greatest regret
at their departure. They had made a plum-cake for Mrs. Lyndsay to
eat during the voyage; and truly it looked big enough to have
lasted out a trip to the South Seas, while Mrs. Gregg had brought
various small tin canisters filled with all sorts of farinaceous
food for the baby.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>Abundant as their kindness was, the blessings and good wishes they
heaped upon the emigrants were more abundant still; the
kind-hearted mother and her bonnie girls, kissing them at parting,
with tears coursing down their rosy cheeks. Mr. Gregg, who was
terribly afraid of the cholera, tried to raise his own spirits, by
describing all the fatal symptoms of the disease, and gave them a
faithful catalogue of those who had died of it that morning in the
city. He had great faith in a new remedy, which was just then
making a noise in the town, which had been tried the day before,
on a relation of his own&#8212;the injection of salt into veins of the
sufferer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it cure him?&#8221; asked Flora, rather eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why no, I canna jest say that it did. But it enabled him to mak&#8217;
his will an&#8217; settle a&#8217; his worldly affairs, which was a great
point gained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the living,&#8221; sighed Flora. &#8220;Small satisfaction to the dying,
to be disturbed in their last agonies, by attending to matters of
business, while a greater reckoning is left unpaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look ill yoursel, Mistress Lyndsay,&#8221; continued the gude man.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope that it&#8217;s not the commencement of the awfu&#8217; disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so myself two days ago,&#8221; said Flora. &#8220;I am grateful to
God that it was not the cholera. Does it ever break out on board
ship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an affliction sae lately sent upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> nations by the
Lord, that we have had sma&#8217; experience o&#8217; the matter,&#8221; quoth Mr.
Gregg. &#8220;Your best chance is to trust in Him. For let us be ever so
cautious, an He wills it, we canna&#8217; escape out o&#8217; His hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is the best way to confide ourselves entirely to His
care, and to think as little about it as we possibly can. All our
precautions remind me of the boy who hid up in the cellar during a
terrible thunderstorm, in the hope that the lightning would never
find him there, little dreaming, that his place of safety exposed
him to as much danger as a stand on the house-top. A man may run
away from a battle, and escape from a fire, but it seems to me of
little use attempting to fly from a pestilence which lurks in the
very air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we take to
nourish us. Faith in the mercy of God, and submission to His will
appear to me the only remedies at all likely to avert the danger
we shrink from with so much fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It comes like a thief in the night,&#8221; said Mr. Gregg; &#8220;and it
behoves us all to mind the warning o&#8217; the Saviour, to watch an&#8217;
pray, for we know not at what hour the Master of the house
cometh.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the good Greggs had made their adieus, Flora felt so much
recovered that she accompanied her husband in a coach, to bid the
rest of their kind friends in Edinburgh farewell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>They drove first to the house of Mr. W., where Flora had spent
many happy days during her sojourn in Leith. Mr. W. had an only
son, who held an official situation at the Cape of Good Hope.
Lyndsay had been on intimate terms with this gentleman during his
residence in the colony; and on his return to Scotland, he was
always a welcome visitor at the house of his parents. They loved
to talk of Willie to Lyndsay, and treasured up as household words
any little anecdotes they could collect of his colonial life. Mrs.
W. and her two daughters were highly accomplished, elegant women.
They took a deep interest in the fate of the emigrants, and were
always devising plans for their future comfort.</p>

<p>As to the father of the family, he was a perfect original&#8212;shrewd,
sarcastic, clever, and <em>very ugly</em>. The world called him morose
and ill-natured; but the world only judged from his face, and most
certainly he should have indicted it for bringing false witness
against him. It was a libellous face, which turned the worst
aspect to the world; its harsh lines and exaggerated features
magnifying mental defects, while they concealed the good qualities
of the warm, generous heart that shone like some precious gem
within that hard rough case.</p>

<p>Mr. W. loved opposition, and courted it. He roused himself up to
an argument, as a terrier dog rouses himself to kill rats; and,
like the said terrier, when he got the advantage of his opponent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
he loved to worry and tease, to hold on till the last, till the
vanquished was fain to cry aloud for mercy; and then his main
object in quitting the dispute was to lie in wait for a fresh
tussel. Flora laughed at all his blunt speeches, and enjoyed his
rude wit, and opposed him, and argued with him to his heart&#8217;s
content, until they became the best friends in the world. Their
first meeting was so characteristic, that we must give it here.</p>

<p>Flora had accepted an invitation to dine, with her husband, at Mr.
W.&#8217;s house. It was only a family party, and they were to come
early. On their arrival, they found that Mr. W. had been called
away on business, but was expected back to dinner. After chatting
awhile to Mrs. W. and her daughters, Flora&#8217;s attention was
strongly directed to an oil-painting which hung above the
drawing-room mantelpiece. It was the portrait of an old man, as
large as life. The figure was represented in a sitting posture,
his head leaning upon his hand, or rather the chin supported in
the open palm. The eyes glanced upward with a sarcastic, humorous
expression, as if the original were in the act of asking some
question which a listener might find it no easy matter to answer;
and a smile of mischievous triumph hovered about the mouth. It was
an extraordinary countenance. No common every-day face, to which
you could point and say, &#8220;Does not that put you in mind of Mr.
So-and-So?&#8221; Memory could supply no duplicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> to this picture. It
was like but one other face in the world, the one from which it
had been faithfully copied. It was originally meant for a handsome
face, but the features were exaggerated until they became
grotesque and coarse in the extreme, and the thick, bushy,
iron-grey hair and whiskers, and clay-coloured complexion, put the
finishing strokes to a portrait, which might be considered the
very <em>ideal of ugliness</em>.</p>

<p>While Flora sat looking at the picture, and secretly wondering how
any person with such a face could bear to see it transferred to
canvas, she was suddenly roused from her reverie by the pressure
of a heavy hand upon her shoulder, and a gentleman in a very
gruff, but by no means an ill-natured or morose voice, thus
addressed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see such a d&#8212;&mdash;d ugly old fellow in your life
before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; returned Flora, very innocently. Then, looking up in his
face, she cried out with a sudden start, and without the least
mental reservation, &#8220;It is the picture of yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is my picture. An excellent likeness&#8212;half bulldog, half
terrier. Judging from that ugly, crabbed old dog over the
mantelpiece, what sort of a fellow ought I to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>He said this with a malicious twinkle in his clear, grey eyes,
which glanced like sparks of fire from under his thick bushy
eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than you look,&#8221; said Flora, laughing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> &#8220;But your question
is not a fair one, Mr. W.; I was taken by surprise, and you must
not press me too hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A clear admission, young lady, that you would rather avoid
telling the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the portrait of a plain man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! You did not qualify it as such in your own mind. Plain&#8212;is
only one degree worse than good-looking. You thought it&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugly&#8212;if you insist upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing worse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eccentric&#8212;pugnacious&#8212;satirical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s truth! But that was not all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens! what am I to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t swear; &#8217;tis not fashionable for ladies. I do it myself; but
&#8217;tis a bad habit. Now shall I tell you what you <em>did think</em> of the
picture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather have your opinion than mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To relieve you from the horns of the dilemma? Well then; you
thought it the ugliest, most repulsive, and withal the oddest phiz
you ever saw; and you wondered how any one with such a hideous,
morose countenance, could ever sit for the picture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried her tormentor, clapping his hands. &#8220;You and I must
be friends. You wonder how I came to guess your thoughts; I know
them by my own. Had any one asked my opinion of the picture of
another man as ugly as that, I should have spoken out plainly
enough. Fortunately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> the qualities of the mind do not depend upon
the beauty of the face; though personal beauty is greatly
increased by the noble qualities of the mind; and I know my inner
man to be as vastly superior to its outer case, as the moon is to
the cloud she pierces with her rays. To mind, I am indebted for
the greatest happiness I enjoy,&#8212;the confidence and affection of
my wife and children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. W. was reckoned pretty in her youth; I think her so still.
She was of a good family too; with a comfortable independence, and
had lovers by the score. Yet, she fell in love with the ugly
fellow, and married him, though he had neither fame nor fortune to
offer her in exchange. Nothing but the mental treasures he had hid
away from the world in this rough casket. My daughters are
elegant, accomplished girls; not beauties, to be sure, but
pleasing enough to be courted and sought after. Yet, they are
proud of being thought like their ugly old father. That picture
must be a likeness; it is pourtrayed by the hand of love. My dear
girl there drew it with her own pencil, and rejoiced that she had
caught the very expression of my face. To her, my dear lady, it is
beautiful&#8212;for love is blind. She does not heed the ugly features;
she only sees the mind she honours and obeys, looking through
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, dear papa, who that knows you, as we know you, could ever
think you ugly?&#8221; said Mary W., laying her hand on the old man&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
shoulder, and looking fondly and proudly in his face. &#8220;But I have
forgotten all this time to introduce you to Mrs. Lyndsay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My old friend Lyndsay&#8217;s wife? I ought not to be pleased with you,
madam, for you disappointed a favourite scheme of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could that possibly be?&#8221; said Flora.</p>

<p>&#8220;I loved that man of yours; I wanted him for a son-in-law. Of
course, neither I nor the girls hinted such a wish to him. But had
he asked, he would not have been refused.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lyndsay!&#8221; broke in Mary W., &#8220;you must not mind papa&#8217;s
nonsense. He will say just what he likes. Mr. Lyndsay was always a
great favourite with us all; and papa would have his joke at our
expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my young friend has thought fit to please himself, and I am
so well pleased with his wife, that she shall sit by the ugly old
man; &#8216;an&#8217; I will ha&#8217; a spate o&#8217; clatter wi&#8217; her to mine ain
sel.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The more Flora saw of the eccentric old man, the more she admired
and respected him. In a little time, she ceased to think him
ugly&#8212;he was only plain and odd-looking; till at length, like all
the rest of Mr. W.&#8217;s friends, she almost believed him handsome.
When did genius ever fail to leave upon the rudest clay, an
impress of its divine origin?</p>

<p>It was with feelings of mutual regret that our emigrants took
leave, and for ever, of this talented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> family. Before the
expiration of one short year, that happy group of kind faces had
passed out of the world! The sudden death of the younger Mr. W.,
who was the idol of the family, brought his mother in sorrow to
the grave. The girls, by some strange fatality, only survived her
a few weeks; and the good old man, bereft of every kindred tie,
pined away and died of a broken heart!</p>

<p>Some years after Flora had been settled in Canada, a gentleman
from Scotland, who had been acquainted with the W. family, told
her that he called upon the old gentleman on a matter of business,
a few days after the funeral of his youngest daughter. The old man
opened the door: he was shrunk to a skeleton, and a perfect image
of woe. When he saw who his visitor was, he shook his thin, wasted
hand at him, with a melancholy, impatient gesture, exclaiming,
&#8220;What brings you here, P&#8212;&mdash;? Leave this death-doomed house! I am
too miserable to attend to anything but my own burden of incurable
grief.&#8221; He called again the following morning. The poor old man
was dead!</p>

<p>The next day the emigrants bade farewell to the beautiful capital
of Scotland. How gladly would Flora have terminated her earthly
pilgrimage in that land of poetry and romance, and spent the rest
of her days among its truthful, high-minded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> hospitable people!
But vain are regrets. The inexorable spirit of progress points
onward; and the beings she chooses to be the parents of a new
people, in a new land, must fulfil their destiny.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1832, the Lyndsays embarked on board the brig
<em>Anne</em>, to seek a new home beyond the Atlantic, and friends in a
land of strangers.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span><a name="XXVII" id="XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>A NEW SCENE AND STRANGE FACES.</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Four</span> o&#8217;clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> had been tolled from all the steeples in
Edinburgh, when Flora stood upon the pier &#8220;o&#8217; Leith,&#8221; watching the
approach of the small boat which was to convey her on board the
ugly black vessel which lay at anchor at the Berwick Law. It was a
warm, close, hazy afternoon; distant thunder muttered among the
hills, and dense clouds floated around the mountain from base to
summit, shrouding its rugged outline in a mysterious robe of mist.
Ever and anon, as the electrical breeze sprang up and stirred
these grey masses of vapour, they rolled up in black shadowy folds
which took all sorts of Ossianic and phantom-like forms&#8212;spirits
of bards and warriors, looking from their grey clouds upon the
land their songs had immortalised, or their valour saved.</p>

<p>Parties of emigrants and their friends were gathered together in
small picturesque groups on the pier. The cheeks of the women were
pale and wet with tears. The words of blessing and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> farewell,
spoken to those near and dear to them, were often interrupted by
low wailing and heart-breaking sobs.</p>

<p>Flora stood apart waiting for her husband, who had been to the
ship, and was in the returning boat now making its way through the
water to take her off. Sad she was, and pale and anxious, for the
wide world was all before her, a world of new scenes and strange
faces. A future as inscrutable and mysterious almost as that from
which humanity instinctively shrinks, which leads so many to cling
with expiring energy to evils with which they have grown familiar,
rather than launch alone into that unknown sea which never bears
upon its bosom a returning sail. Ah! well is it for the poor
trembling denizens of earth that&#8212;</p>

<div class="block3">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">&#8220;Heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">or how could they bear up from day to day against the
accumulated ills which beset them at every turn along the crooked
paths of life?</p>

<p>Flora had already experienced that bitterness of grief, far worse
than death, which separates the emigrant from the home of his
love, the friends of his early youth, the land of his birth; and
she shed no tear over the mournful recollection, though the deep
sigh which shook her heart to its inmost depths, told that it was
still felt and painfully present to her memory. She stood alone
among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> that weeping crowd; no kindred hand was there to press hers
for the last, last time, or bid God speed her on her perilous
voyage. What a blessing it would have been at that moment, to have
bent a parting glance on some dear familiar face, and gathered
strength and consolation from eyes full of affection and sympathy!</p>

<p>The beautiful landscape which had so often cheered and gladdened
her heart, during her brief sojourn, no longer smiled upon her,
but was obscured in storm and gloom. The thunder which had only
muttered at a distance, now roared among the cloud-capped hills,
and heavy drops of rain began to patter slowly upon the earth and
sea. These bright globules in advance of the heavy shower whose
approach they announced, made small dimples in the waters,
spreading anon into large circles, until the surface of the salt
brine seemed to boil and dance, which a few minutes before had
lain so glassy and still, beneath the hot breath of the coming
storm. Flora thought how soon those billows would chafe and roar
for ever between her and her native land.</p>

<p>Then the lines of Nature&#8217;s own bard, the unhappy but immortal
Burns, whose fame had become as eternal as those ancient hills,
rose to her mind, and she could fancy him standing upon that very
spot, breathing out from the depths of his great inspired heart,
the painful separation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> he anticipated, when called by adverse
circumstances to leave old Scotia&#8217;s shores, and the woman he
adored&#8212;</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="io">&#8220;The boat rocks at the pier o&#8217; Leith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship rides at the Berwick Law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I maun leave my bonnie Mary.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The words still hovered on her lips when the boat touched the
pier, and her husband threw his arms around her, and lifted her
and the dear offspring of their mutual love, into the small bark
which was to bear them away from the glorious land of Bruce and
Burns. The men bent to their oars, and in a few <a name="minutes" id="minutes"></a><ins title="miuutes in original">minutes</ins> she found
herself one among the many strangers that crowded the narrow deck
of the emigrant ship.</p>

<p>The downpouring of the thunder-shower compelled her to take
instant refuge in the cabin, followed by Hannah and the child. The
little dingy place dignified by that name, was crowded with trunks
and packages, piled upon each other in endless confusion. And the
close atmosphere was rendered more hot and suffocating from the
mingled odours of brandy, onions, red-herrings, and tobacco. The
smoke from several pipes floated in lazy wreaths through the
confined space, and effectually concealed, for the first few
minutes, the parties indulging in the dreamy luxury of the
fragrant weed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>The gloom occasioned by the passing thunder-clouds produced a dim
twilight in the little room, which looked more like the den in a
travelling menagerie, appropriated to the use of some imprisoned
lord of the desert, than a fitting habitation for civilized men
and women.</p>

<p>Flora groped her way to the bench which surrounded the walls, and,
for a few minutes, covered her face with her hands, to conceal her
agitation and keep down the swelling of her heart, before she
gained sufficient courage to reconnoitre the aspect of her
temporary home. At length, she succeeded in calming her feelings,
and was able to look about her.</p>

<p>The Captain was sitting upon a large trunk in his shirt-sleeves,
with a short pipe stuck between his teeth, holding in one hand a
tumbler of brandy punch, and in the other a bundle of papers
containing a list of his passengers, which he was in the act of
proffering for the inspection of the excise officers, who were
settling with him sundry matters of business, connected with the
cargo of the ship.</p>

<p>Two sinister, ill-looking men they were, who spoke with loud,
authoritative voices, and, for the time being, appeared masters of
the vessel and all that it contained, examining with provoking
exactness, cupboards, bedding, boxes, and binns of biscuit, till
there seemed no end to their prying and vexatious system of
cross-questioning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>The Captain notified his consciousness of the presence of the
new-comers with a short nod of recognition; but he was too much
occupied to welcome them with words. He seemed in a desperate
ill-humour with his official visitors, and replied to all their
queries with a significant elevation of his broad shoulders, and a
brief &#8220;No&#8221; or &#8220;Yes,&#8221; which greatly resembled a growl.</p>

<p>During his absence on deck, whither he accompanied the senior
officer, his companion, who was seated on the bench opposite to
that occupied by Mrs. Lyndsay and her maid, with his back to an
open binn, full of biscuits and other sea-stores, took the
opportunity afforded by the Captain&#8217;s departure, to fill the huge
pockets in his large jacket with the said stores, until his tall,
lank person, was swelled out into very portly dimensions. He then
made a sudden dash at the brandy-bottle (which the Captain had
left on the table), and, casting a thievish glance at Mrs.
Lyndsay, who was highly amused by watching his movements, he
refilled his glass, and tossed it off with the air of a child who
is afraid of being detected, while on a foraging expedition into
Mamma&#8217;s cupboard. This matter settled, he wiped his mouth with the
cuff of his jacket, and assumed a look of vulgar consequence and
superiority, which must have forced a smile to Flora&#8217;s lips had
she been at all in a humour for mirth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>&#8220;Strange!&#8221; she thought, as she sat muffled up in her cloak, a
silent spectatress of his man&#339;uvres, &#8220;that such a mean,
dishonest wretch as this, should be empowered to act the petty
tyrant, and pass judgment on the integrity of others, who is so
destitute of the principles of common honesty himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>She certainly forgot, during her mental colloquy, the wisdom
concealed beneath the homely adage, &#8220;Set a thief to catch a
thief!&#8221; and the profound knowledge of the world hidden in that
brief, pithy sentence.</p>

<p>The provoking business of inspection (for so it seemed to the
Captain&#8212;to judge by his flushed cheek and frowning brow,) was at
length over; the officers withdrew, and were succeeded by the
doctor, who was appointed to inspect the health of the crew and
passengers, before the ship sailed.</p>

<p>Doctor <a name="macadie" id="macadie"></a><ins title="Mac Adie in original">MacAdie</ins> was a lively, little, red haired man, with high
cheek-bones, and a large Roman nose out of all proportion to the
size of his diminutive body, but perfectly harmonising with his
wide, sensible-looking mouth. His sharp, clear blue eyes, seemed
to have crept as close to his nose as they possibly could, in the
vain hope of glancing over the high, ridgy barrier it formed
between them, which gave to their owner a peculiarly acute,
penetrating expression,&#8212;a glance which appeared to look you
through and through;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> yet, though extremely grotesque, it was a
benevolent, pleasing face, full of blunt kindness and ready wit.</p>

<p>The Doctor&#8217;s snuff-box seemed part and parcel of himself; for the
quaint, old-fashioned horn repository, which contained the pungent
powder, <em>real Scotch</em>, never left his hand during his professional
dialogue with Mrs. Lyndsay.</p>

<p>He shook his head, as his keen eyes read sickness of mind and body
in her weary and care-worn face. &#8220;Ye are ill, my gude leddy,&#8221; said
he in broad Scotch; &#8220;in nae condition to undertak&#8217; sic a lang
voyage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lyndsay answered frankly and truly, that she had been
indisposed during the past week, and her recovery was so recent,
that she felt much better in health than her looks warranted.</p>

<p>The Doctor examined her tongue, felt her pulse, and still shook
his head doubtingly. &#8220;Feverish&#8212;rapid pulse&#8212;bad tongue&#8212;just out
o&#8217; yer bed, from attack near akin to cholera. I tell ye that ye
are mair fit to go to bed again, under the dochtor&#8217;s care, than to
attempt crossing the Atlantic in a close crib like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fresh sea air will soon restore me to health,&#8221; said Flora.
&#8220;You know, Doctor, that we cannot command circumstances, and have
things exactly as we could wish;&#8221; and she checked the sigh which
rose to her lips, as she recalled to mind her dear, comfortable
cottage at &#8212;&mdash;, and glanced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> round the narrow cabin, and its
miserable accommodations.</p>

<p>The Doctor regarded her with eyes full of compassion. He certainly
guessed her thoughts, and seemed as well acquainted with
complaints of the mind as with bodily ailments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weel, weel, I ha&#8217;e my ain doubts as to your fitness for sic a
voyage in your weak state; but I&#8217;ll e&#8217;en jist let ye pass. Are you
married or single?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; the gudeman?&#8212;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is on deck with the captain. He will be here presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha&#8217;e ye ony bairns?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora pointed, with a feeling of maternal pride, to the little
Josey, who was sleeping upon Hannah&#8217;s knees,&#8212;a lovely picture of
healthy, happy infancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, she&#8217;s bonnie,&#8221; cried the kind Doctor, taking one of the tiny
alabaster fingers of the babe in his red, rough hand. &#8220;Sma&#8217; need
o&#8217; a dochter in her case. An&#8217; wha&#8217;s this woman?&#8221; touching Hannah&#8217;s
shoulder with his forefinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;My nurse-girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A married woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She shu&#8217;d be, I&#8217;m jist thinkin&#8217;; it will not be lang before she&#8217;s
a mither,&#8221; muttered the little man. Then, turning quickly to
Flora, he said, &#8220;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> wull speak to the medical man on board, an&#8217;
tell him to tak&#8217; partic&#8217;lar care o&#8217; you during the voyage. What&#8217;s
his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no such person. The vessel is too small to incur such an
expensive addition to the comfort of her passengers. The captain
told me that he was his own doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many passengers does he tak&#8217; out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventy-two in the steerage, five in the cabin, besides his crew,
eight in number.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighty-five human beings, an&#8217; no medical man on board! &#8217;Tis jest
a&#8217; disgrace to the owners, and shu&#8217;d be reported. In case o&#8217;
cholera, or ony other epeedemic brakin&#8217; out amang ye, wha wu&#8217;d
become o&#8217; ye a&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must trust in God. The great Physician of souls will not be
forgetful of our bodily infirmities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, true, young leddy; cling close to Him. Ye ha&#8217; muckle need
o&#8217; His care. An&#8217; dinna trust your life to the dochtering o&#8217; a
sullen ignoramus like the captain,&#8212;an obstinate, self-willed
brute, that, right or wrang, will ha&#8217; his ain way. Dinna tak&#8217; ony
medicine frae him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was amused at the idea of calling in a one-eyed Esculapius
like the jolly captain. The absurdity of the thing made her laugh
heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nae laughing matter,&#8221; said the little doctor, whose
professional dignity was evidently wounded by her mistimed mirth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>&#8220;Hout! dinna&#8217; I ken the man for the last ten years or mair. Thae
medicine kist he prizes mair than his sole remaining e&#8217;e, an&#8217;
fancies himsel a dochtor fitting a king. Ye canna&#8217; please him mair
than by gie&#8217;n&#8217; him a job. The last voyage he made in this verra
brig, he administered in his ignorance, a hale pint o&#8217; castor oil
in ain dose to a lad on board, which took the puir fallow aff his
legs completely. Anither specimen o&#8217; his medical skill was gie&#8217;n
are o&#8217; his crew, a heapen spun-fu&#8217; o&#8217; calomel, which he mistook
for magnesia. I varilie believe that he canna&#8217; spell weel eneugh
to read the directions in the buik. An&#8217; is it to sic a dunderheid
that the lives of eighty-five human beings are to be entrusted?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was highly entertained by this account of the Captain&#8217;s
skill; while the doctor, who loved to hear himself talk, continued
in a more impressive and confidential tone&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, dinna be sae ill-advised as to be takin&#8217; pheesic a&#8217; the
time, young leddy. If ye wu&#8217;d keep yersel in health, persuade the
Captain to gie ye the charge o&#8217; yon kist o&#8217; poisons, an&#8217; tak&#8217; the
first opportunity to drap the key by accident overboord. By sae
doin&#8217; ye may be the savin&#8217; o&#8217; your ain life, an&#8217; the lives of a&#8217;
the humanities on boord the brig <em>Anne</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flora was fond of a little amateur doctoring. To part with the
medicine-chest, she considered, would be a great sin, and she was
already secretly longing to overhaul its contents.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>A few well-established remedies, promptly administered in simple
cases of illness, and followed by the recovery of the patients,
had made her imagine herself quite a genius in the healing art;
and she rejected the homely little Doctor&#8217;s last piece of advice
as an eccentric whim, arising either from ignorance of his
profession, or from disappointment in not having been appointed
surgeon to the brig.</p>

<p>Dr. MacAdie was neither deficient in skill nor talent. He was a
poor man, of poor parentage, who had worked hard to obtain his
present position, and provide a comfortable home for his father
and mother in their old age. His practice was entirely confined to
the humble walks of life, and he was glad to obtain a few
additional meals for a large family by inspecting the health of
emigrants preparatory to their voyage.</p>

<p>In this case, his certificate of health was very satisfactory; and
he told the Captain that he had seldom seen a heartier, healthier
set o&#8217; <em>decent</em> bodies in sic a sma&#8217; vessel, and hepathetically
entreated him not to tamper with their constitutions, by giving
them dangerous drugs whose chemical properties he did not
understand, declaring emphatically, &#8220;That nature was the best
<em>phesician</em> after all.&#8221; The Captain considered this gratuitous
piece of advice as an insult, for he very gruffly bade Doctor
MacAdie &#8220;Take care of his own patients; he wanted none of his
impertinent interference.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>The little Doctor drew up his shoulders with an air of profound
contempt; then taking a monstrous pinch of snuff, in the most
sneezable manner, from his old-fashioned box, he shook Mrs.
Lyndsay kindly by the hand, and wishing her and her <em>gudeman</em> a
prosperous voyage, vanished up the companion-ladder.</p>

<p>Old Boreas shook his fist after his retreating figure. &#8220;You
d&#8212;&mdash;d, insignificant, snuffy little coxcomb! I&#8217;m a d&#8212;&mdash;d sight
better doctor than you are. If the Government sends you again,
poking your long nose among my people, I&#8217;ll make a surgical case
for you to examine at home at your leisure, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>In order to divert his ill-humour, Flora inquired at what hour the
ship sailed?</p>

<p>&#8220;She must wait for that which never yet waited for mortal
man&#8212;wind and tide. It will be midnight before we get under
weigh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boreas always spoke in short sentences. He was a man of few words,
rough, ready, and eccentrically blunt. Had his talents been
proportioned to his obstinacy of will, he might have ruled over
large communities, instead of acting the petty tyrant on the deck
of his small craft. Right or wrong, he never gave up his opinion
to any one. He certainly did not belong to the &#8220;<em>Ay, Sir&#8212;very
true, Sir</em>&#8221;&#8212;school of individuals, who would resign their own
souls to agree with their superiors in rank or power. If there was
a being on earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> that he despised more than another, it was a
sneak. On one occasion, when a steerage passenger, in order to
curry favour, was prostrating himself before him after this
fashion, assuring the Captain, &#8220;That <em>his</em> thoughts coincided
<em>exactly</em> with his own,&#8221; he burst out in a towering passion,
&#8220;D&#8212;&mdash; you Sir! haven&#8217;t you got an opinion of your own? I don&#8217;t
want such a sneaking puppy as you to think my thoughts, and echo
my words. I should despise myself, if I thought it possible that
we could agree on any subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>If really convinced that he was wrong, he would show it by a
slight diminution of his ferocious stubbornness; but would never
acknowledge it in words. If he gained even a doubtful advantage
over an adversary, he rubbed his hands, clapped his knees, and
chuckled and growled out his satisfaction, in a manner peculiarly
his own. He was only tolerable as a companion after taking his
third glass of brandy-and-water; and as he commenced these
humanizing doses by daybreak in the morning, repeating them at
stated intervals during the four-and-twenty hours, by noon he
became sociable and entertaining; and would descend from his
anti-meridian dignity, and condescend to laugh and chat in a dry
humorous style, which, if it lacked refinement, was highly
amusing.</p>

<p>Though an inveterate imbiber of alcohol, he was never positively
drunk during the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span> voyage. The evil spirits seemed to make no
impression upon the iron fibres of his stubborn brain and heart.
He judged his morality by the toughness of his constitution, and
congratulated himself on being a sober man, while he complained of
his second mate, and stigmatised him as a drunken, worthless
fellow, because one glass of punch made him intoxicated. This is
by no means an uncommon thing both at home and abroad; and men
condemn others more for want of strength of head, than strength of
heart.</p>
